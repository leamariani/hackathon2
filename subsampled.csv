"I get that developing technologies for space travel is inspiring, but that's just a pr thing. There is zero net gain for Mars colonies beyond vanity projects. Nothing in space will ever economically benefit anyone on earth. There is no such thing as bringing resources or wealth back to earth. 

We already have a captured asteroid in earth's orbit that is closer than any other resource in space and even that is so far removed from feasibility, the wealth we could extract from our own planet in comparison isn't even a conversation. The whole reason North America became prosperous is because we got to exploit a whole new continent. Antarctica is larger than all of North America.

"I want to preface this by saying, I believe in climate change.  I know parts of the world outside the US are already suffering its effects.  I know in the US we're seeing increasing intensity of storms and California is currently on fire.

But, one criticism I have of the reporting of climate change, is we over complicate the benchmarking.  We keep saying ""1.5C over pre-industrial temps"".  That sounds fuzzy, and needlessly complicated.  No where in the 3 pages, and 3 charts of the article, does it state plainly what the global average temperature was last year.  The relativee change is an important benchmark, and it highlights that things are changing.  But for the skeptical, for the audience you're trying to convince to prioritize fighting climate change, I think it's also important to write down the actual temperatures being compared, so as to eliminate skepticism that scientists might later change the data or move the goal posts.",0

"I assure you of something: you'd see the exact opposite of this map if it was about worries regarding attack from russia. This isn't about far right - the question is if it's a *top* worry.
Climate change is a horrific thing that will eventually affect us all.

russia has repeatedly threatened to invade Eastern Europe, and European intelligence is corroborating that, with a timeline of 6months-5 years. Which is akin to extinction for majority of Eastern Europeans.

So you'd see the war in Ukraine not being a *top* worry for Southern/Western Europe (as opposed to Eastern), and you see the reverse of that regarding climate change.

"&gt; We don't have any national carbon taxes in the US. Are there even state level carbon taxes?

Along the west coast of the united states, there are fuel taxes which are carbon-motivated that result in fuel cost increases at the consumer level.  And states like WA have passed the Carbon Committment Act and CA has a Cap and Trade program. 

&gt; I highly doubt this. Voter disenfranchisement has been a big issue in a number of states around the country. If you're in a red state, it's probably a big issue. Blue state, could be depending on the county and local politics.

&gt; But also, you see no personal benefit to living in a country where voting rights are respected?

This is moot in my state which is very pro-voting on the west coast of the US.  This is a moot issue becuase I don't have the means to do anything to change a red state.  My state will always vote blue in national elections and my state's representatives will always advocate for voting rights at the national level.  There is literally nothing for me to do from a collective perspective. 

&gt; That sounds like you made a really bad decision if you couldn't maintain your home without rent from a tenant.

Several of my friends lost investment homes too.  If single family renters are driven out of the market, what is left is large scale corporations that can absorb the loss.  So, regardless of my personal decisions, the policy is bad and I won't support it.  No homeowner will be able to float a home for a year without paying rent, which is what some of the current rules in blue states requie with policies that nearly prohibit evictions.  So, even if it didn't impact me personally I think the pendulum has gone too far.  

&gt; Do you benefit from say, less homeless people dying in the streets? Is that the kind of society you think is beneficial to your family, your kids?

I don't think my family benefits from less homeless people dying in the streets.  What good is aid to the homeless person, if my family joins them in the process?

&gt; As for things like carbon taxes, oil and gas is cheap because all of the externalities get pushed onto everybody else. You're spreading out the misery. Less pollution, mitigating climate change, encouraging building more public transportation and walkable cities and towns, all of these things bring your family a lot of benefits.

Perhaps.  But none of this matters if my needs are not taken care of first.  If the airplane experiences depressurization, the mask first goes on my own face before I help others.",1

~60% of Canada's energy needs are already met by Hydro, and we sell a lot of excess to the US that could be rerouted through Canada or stored with better tech. And we're far from fully utilizing wind, solar and/or geothermal, all of which have had their costs steadily (and rapidly) dropping.

&gt;But acting like Canada is going to be a place to lead this charge is just a recipe for a failed ROI.

Canada is a world leader on nuclear energy technology and as well on hydro/wind technology. We have the raw natural resources, the expertise and the technology to lead an energy transition if we really wanted to.  We don't need to sit around selling oil waiting for China to come to our rescue.",1

"They do a shit ton of psychological damage, but the damage they cause are minimized by the Iron Dome, a defense technology that Israel developed with the support of the United States; support the anti-Israel crowd want pulled. 

Last year a Hezbollah rocket broke past the Iron Dome and killed 10 Druze children. Hamas themselves have launched 20,000 rockets since 2005, marking intention to kill 200,000 children by a direct comparison, at a bare minimum. You cannot say the rockets are inconsequential just because Israel has good and innovative defenses that, again, you’d rather them not have. 

I grew up around gun violence but was never shot. Do you believe that there was no damage done to me as a result of this gun violence?

I figured out growing up that the last thing you want to do is give a thug a reason to hurt you, no matter how mad they make you and no matter humiliated you feel. Provoking a thug puts your entire clan at risk and destabilizes the community. That’s exactly what Hamas has been doing with Netanyahu and vice versa. They both believe the best interest of their community is one state, and they believe this horrendous is war is worth it. It’s not. This also means pursuing one state cannot be what is best, therefore one cannot truly be Pro Palestine without being Pro Israel and vice versa. ",0

"*The circumstances surrounding a proposed initiation of a referendum on Bulgaria’s entry date to the Eurozone are symptomatic of the country’s rule of law decay.*

On May 9, 2025, Bulgaria’s President Rumen Radev [proposed](https://www.president.bg/news8355/rumen-radev-vavezhdaneto-na-edinnata-evropeyska-valuta-mozhe-i-tryabva-da-stane-s-ubeditelen-natsionalen-konsensus-a-ne-s-prenebrezhitelno-nezachitane-na-volyata-na-horata.html) the initiation of a referendum on the date of Bulgaria’s joining the Eurozone. His initiative caused a political storm and public hysteria, but, most of all, shone a light on the extent of capture of Bulgarian institutions, including parliament.

Polls carried out earlier this year by *Myara* [showed](https://myara.bg/eurozone-bulgaria-1249/) that 51.7 per cent of Bulgarians oppose Bulgaria’s Eurozone entry *in principle* while 39 per cent support it *in principle*. Meanwhile, when reminded that joining the euro area is one of the country’s obligations under the EU Treaties and in view of current efforts to adopt the euro on January 1st, 2026, 41.4 per cent of respondents[ asserted](https://myara.bg/eurozone-bulgaria-1249/) that Bulgaria should “never” join the Eurozone while 30.8 per cent stated that it should join at a later stage.

As Bulgaria is a country in which appearances can be deceiving and as populist rhetoric is common even among non-nationalist parties, to understand what lurks behind the Eurozone debate and its implications, one needs to take a step back.

**The Eurozone as a smokescreen propelling autocracy**

A series of corruption scandals as well as a raid against Radev’s Presidency on July 9th, 2020 which was perceived as an attempted coup, ignited mass [anticorruption protests](https://neweasterneurope.eu/2020/10/28/bulgaria-100-days-of-protests/) against Borissov’s third government that lasted more than one-hundred days. Coincidentally, on the following day, July 10th, 2020, the European Commission made the [surprising announcement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1321) that Bulgaria (and Croatia) had been included in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), also known as Eurozone’s ‘waiting room’.

Whether Bulgaria’s acceptance into the ERM II was the result of an objective evaluation or last-minute behind-the-scenes political deals facilitated by the European People’s Party (EPP) is subject to debate. Considering the Commission’s own [deplorable record](https://kluwerlawonline.com/journalarticle/european+public+law/26.3/euro2020062) of dual standards in monitoring Bulgaria’s compliance with EU law, Borissov’s warm ties to the EPP, and Manfred Weber’s [public statement](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/12/bulgaria-corruption-crisis-358610) that he admired Borissov’s fight against corruption dated July 10th, 2020, one is entitled to serious doubts. What was visible, however, was that Borissov quickly [blamed](https://btvnovinite.bg/bulgaria/borisov-razdelenata-darzhava-ne-e-mojata-darzhava.html) the protesting citizens of not being “joyful” about Bulgaria’s success and jeopardizing the country’s bright future that only he could ensure.",1

"This isn’t true, there is no “standard” species concept. What you described is what gets taught in high school biology classes, but that doesn’t mean it’s more valid than other species concepts. That doesn’t work for anything extinct, for example, so it’s not a good species concept to apply to dire wolves anyway. And there are plenty of organisms who hybridize across species or even genera – plus plenty more organisms that reproduce asexually. 

Ultimately, taxonomy is a human system, and it’s important because it helps us understand biodiversity and evolution, but life is complicated, hence the need for many species concepts, and plenty of instances where they fall apart. I’ve never heard a description like Shapiro’s, though. 

I would agree that these aren’t dire wolves, they’re genetically modified grey wolves, with the genetic modifications to make them look like the company’s interpretation of a dire wolf. They say they made those modifications based on the dire wolf genome, but honestly they could have based it on what we know about their morphology, too. There’s no actual dire wolf DNA in these animals.",0

Also a lot of money that goes towards eco-schemes gets wasted on either offsetting carbon costs by paying off 3rd world nations with more forestry, or by buying into renewables or other forms of offset or reduction that do not actually reduce carbon costs or impact. For example wind energy is not carbon neutral, because of the required resources to both construct and operate wind turbines. Electric cars generated from gas, are less efficient than combustion cars.  Hydrogen cars amplify water vapour in the atmosphere and so would actually be much much worse than combustion cars emitting carbon.

"Really, no contradictions?

“Contradictions

The Bible is an unreliable authority because it contains numerous contradictions. Logically, if two statements are contradictory, at least one of them is false. The biblical contradictions therefore prove that the book has many false statements and is not infallible.

Examples of Old Testament Contradictions

The contradictions start in the opening chapters of the Bible, where inconsistent creation stories are told. Genesis chapter 1 says the first man and woman were made at the same time, and after the animals. But Genesis chapter 2 gives a different order of creation: man, then the animals, and then woman.

Genesis chapter 1 lists six days of creation, whereas chapter 2 refers to the “day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” Genesis 1:2-3 claims that God created light and divided it from darkness on the first day; but Genesis 1:14-19 tells us the sun, moon, and stars weren’t made until the fourth day.

Chapter 1 reports that the fruit trees were created before the man, while chapter 2 indicates they were made after him. Genesis 1:20 says the fowl were created out of the waters; Genesis 2:19 alleges they were formed from the ground.

Contradictions are also seen in the biblical story of a worldwide flood. According to Genesis 6:19-22, God ordered Noah to bring “of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort . . . into the ark.” Nevertheless, Genesis 7:2-3 relates that the Lord ordered Noah to take into the ark the clean beasts and the birds by sevens, and only the unclean beasts by twos.

Genesis 8:4 reports that, as the waters of the flood receded, Noah’s ark rested on the mountains of Ararat in the seventh month. The very next verse, however, says the mountaintops could not be seen until the tenth month.

Genesis 8:13 describes the earth as being dry on the first day of the first month. But Genesis 8:14 informs us the earth was not dry until the twenty-seventh day of the second month.

The Old Testament contains an interesting contradiction in the story of the census taken by King David and the resulting punishment of the Israelites. God was so angered by the census that he sent a plague that killed 70,000 men. According to II Samuel 24:1, the Lord had caused David to take the census – which makes the punishment appear even more nonsensical. But an attempt was later made, at I Chronicles 21:1, to improve God’s image by claiming that Satan incited the census.

Further, the Old Testament is contradictory as to whether the Lord commanded the Israelites to sacrifice animals to him. At Jeremiah 7:22, God denies he ever gave the Israelites commandments about animal sacrifices. In contrast, Exodus 29:38-42 and many other verses depict God as requiring the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices.

Examples of New Testament Contradictions

In the New Testament, there are contradictions between the genealogies of Jesus given in the first chapter of Matthew and the third chapter of Luke.

Both genealogies begin with Jesus’ father, who is identified as Joseph (which is curious, given that Mary was supposedly impregnated by the Holy Ghost). But Matthew says Joseph’s father was Jacob, while Luke claims he was Heli. Matthew lists 26 generations between Jesus and King David, whereas Luke records 41. Matthew runs Jesus’ line of descent through David’s son Solomon, while Luke has it going through David’s son Nathan.

The story of Jesus’ birth is also contradictory. Matthew 2:13-15 depicts Joseph and Mary as fleeing to Egypt with the baby Jesus immediately after the wise men from the east had brought gifts.

But Luke 2:22-40 claims that after the birth of Jesus, his parents remained in Bethlehem for the time of Mary’s purification (which was 40 days, under the Mosaic law). Afterwards, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem “to present him to the Lord,” and then returned to their home in Nazareth. Luke mentions no journey into Egypt or visit by wise men from the east.

Concerning the death of Judas, the disloyal disciple, Matthew 27:5 states he took the money he had received for betraying Jesus, threw it down in the temple, and “went and hanged himself.” To the contrary, Acts 1:18 claims Judas used the money to purchase a field and “falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.”

In describing Jesus being led to his execution, John 19:17 recounts that he carried his own cross. But Mark 15:21-23 disagrees by saying a man called Simon carried the cross.

As for the crucifixion, Matthew 27:44 tells us Jesus was taunted by both criminals who were being crucified with him. But Luke 23:39-43 relates that only one of the criminals taunted Jesus, the other criminal rebuked the one who was doing the taunting, and Jesus told the criminal who was defending him, “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.”

Regarding the last words of Jesus while on the cross, Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34 quote Jesus as crying with a loud voice, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” Luke 23:46 gives his final words as, “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” John 19:30 alleges the last words were, “It is finished.”

There are even contradictions in the accounts of the resurrection – the supposed event that is the very foundation of the Christian religion. Mark 16:2 states that on the day of the resurrection, certain women arrived at the tomb at the rising of the sun. But John 20:1 informs us they arrived when it was yet dark. Luke 24:2 describes the tomb as open when the women arrived, whereas Matthew 28:1-2 indicates it was closed. Mark 16:5 declares that the women saw a young man at the tomb, Luke 24:4 says they saw two men, Matthew 28:2 reports they saw an angel, and John 20:11-12 claims they saw two angels.

Also in the resurrection stories, there are contradictions as to the identity of the women who came to the tomb,[7] whether the men or angels the women saw were inside or outside the tomb,[8] whether the men or angels were standing or sitting,[9] and whether Mary Magdalene recognized the risen Jesus when he first appeared to her.[10]

As a final example of a New Testament contradiction, the conflicting accounts of Paul’s conversion can be cited. Acts 9:7 states that when Jesus called Paul to preach the gospel, the men who were with Paul heard a voice but saw no man. According to Acts 22:9, however, the men saw a light but didn’t hear the voice speaking to Paul.

The foregoing examples are just a few of the hundreds of contradictions contained in the Old and New Testaments. Each contradiction is an instance where at least one of the verses is wrong. Thus, hundreds of contradictions mean there are at least hundreds of incorrect statements in the Bible.”

"True artificial general intelligence of course means short term replacement of all jobs.

“AGI” will most probably never be implemented because it would involve political/social consensus.

IMO, the solution will be like what was done in Japan, to make the interests rates collapse and provide QE infinity. (It will come organically with the astonishing deflation proto AGI will bring early on).

People will continue going to work, taking loans to study, but no real work will happen/be required anymore.

I don’t think the majority of the population will accept becoming useless like that.

Soviet communism was exactly providing that: a dignifying professional activity that is non productive economically.

This will be necessary for a short transition period. People will quickly find fulfilling but economically unproductive activities themselves.

If Iran truly was suicidal and wanted to destroy Israel even if it meant their own destruction; they could have done so before the fall of Assad. Their missiles are clearly capable of breaching the iron dome. Without any airplanes overhead they could launch salvos of hundreds at a time at Israeli population centers. They could take their non-weapons grade uranium and make dirty bomb warheads to blanket Israel in radioactive material. They could have developed biological weapons to deliver on their missiles. But they didnt.

The world is more dependent on trade than it was in the past. And it will continue to be in the future, with or without the US. This is one of the driving factors of lower levels of conflict: prosperity. The EU has essentially prevented any war from ever starting again in Western Europe. Globally, more countries are enjoying better economic growth and more people are achieving greater educational attainment. Healthcare around the entire globe has improved. 

&gt;The very fact that the last decade consistently slowed and in some ways reversed social progress made over a century should concern you.

I didn't say it didn't concern me. Specifically what is happening where I live. 

Abortion used to be a very settled matter in the states. Now it isn't. 

We used to have a judiciary with exceptional capacity over the executive's interpretation of law. Now that's questionable. 

Accreditation of various educational bodies is going down the tubes. The crown jewel of American science is waning. 

PEPFAR has gone the way of the dodo, making HIV likely to make a resurgence which will likely increase our infection rates. 

Polarization has become worse. Seemingly the other side is now on a wholesale McCarthy era frenzy of believing in a liberal cabal of satanic panic.

A founding state of NATO is now informally questioning the organization's existence.

The largest economy in the history of the world is exiting world trade for delusions of grandeur in becoming a sweatshop again. 

We have, quite possibly, the most corrupt man to ever hold the office of the presidency. Seems also hell bent to return us to the good ol' days of the corrupt spoils system as well.

But you compare all this to what happened over a century ago? It's nothing. We will right this course. I don't know when, but it will be corrected. The course correction also isn't an unknown question of what we have to do to ensure it's corrected. On the positive: crime is still low, the US still has the strongest services sector+business culture bar none (likely still will even in recession), renewable energy is still going down in price, there's less gerrymandering since the last redistricting in most states, and states have generally reinvested into their public schools.

The countries that have been the highest emitters since the Industrial Revolution and benefitted greatly from that should have the greatest responsibility to curb their emissions.

"&gt; colonialism alone didn’t create lasting national wealth; factors like strong institutions, governance, and innovation matter far more. 

There are two counter-arguments: 

1) Colonialism mattered more at the time - The colonial period started in what, the 1400s? At the time, Europe was an agricultural economy. Seizing another country's agricultural lands would make you richer, and there were plenty of wars to try and achieve that. England and France warred for centuries for instance. This would be unthinkable today, because it's the entrepreneurs and institutions that make both countries rich, and you couldn't get that wealth by taking territory militarily. But that doesn't mean you couldn't get rich from colonialism in the 15th century. Besides, the institutions hadn't been invented yet. Corporations weren't invented until at least the 16th century. Copyright law wasn't invented until the 18th. The industrial revolution didn't really kick off until the late 18th century. 

2) Colonialism might matter more in the future - Right now, there's no good argument for trying to do colonialism for economic reasons, as explained above. But in future, it might be. For instance, as AI gets better and more creative, it might end up better at being able to spot a human need and fill it. At that point, entrepreneurship becomes a cheap commodity that everyone can have, and wealth will go to those that control actual resources. At that point, land-based assets, like agricultural land and mines become much more economically important than human capital, and colonialism becomes a good idea again. Whoever still has any will become rich.",1

Yeah! By working with and using religious schools and texts. Christian schools where the indigenous people’s names were changed so that they could have proper “Christian” names. Where their religions were seen as “pagan” and “heathen” or witchcraft. 

Christian missionaries worked hand in hand with colonial governments and companies in order to have the cover of “civilizing” the natives. 

Why do you think Christianity was used as a means to justify both slavery and colonialism? Why do you think the “white man’s burden” and “the white savior complex” both invoke and contain religious ideology and language? 

Let’s not rewrite history in order to justify bigotry against Muslim people. 

_In the Caribbean, slaves had to invent their own language to e able to communicate with each other, and also learn English. Then you had the baptists and the catholic come in and preach to slaves. Those  ministers did not force them to learn english_

I suspect they did. I cannot say for certain, as I do not know as much about the Caribbean (so I probably am hilariously wrong) but based on how Christian missionaries functioned and worked with colonial governments in other parts of the world there is a high chance that they did. Or they actively worked to destroy and replace indigenous religions and cultures.",0

"&gt;It is a sickness, they've lost the human checks and balances, what makes us humans.


Yep.  That's one way of describing transhumanism.


It's a mind parasite, and the parasite exerts it's influence on their thinking to guard the parasite against all efforts to remove it, ___above all else___, even to the detriment of the infected host mind.


In case anybody doesn't know:


A mind parasite is a malignant set of information akin to a computer virus, except in this case; the information processor is the infected host's thinking, and: whereas an infected host naturally fights against a _viral_ infection (except computers require additional artificiality to do so, since they're already artificial), a _parasite_ tricks it's host into giving over host resources _to_ the parasite, and protecting the parasite against removal, even if that means harm to the infected host or others.


Mind parasites are every bit as real as computer viruses are, and they are every bit as destructive in information-space as physical parasites can be in material-space.


An important point here is that our physical bodies are the result of about __500 million years__ of animal evolution in our environment, where there has always been viruses, which are still simply viruses to this day.


Therefore we have a sophisticated and competent immune system to defend our physical bodies against physical viruses.  


Physical _parasites_ are more difficult to fight against because they game and exploit the natural activity of our bodies.  Even so; our immune systems have _some_ defensive capabilities against physical parasites.


But humanity only barely began being an _active_ participant in information-space some thousands or tens of thousands of years ago, as far as I can tell.


The rise of information-space parasites is an inevitable result of combinatorics, just as physical viruses and parasites were inevitable.


Humanity has put significant effort into trying to understand factors that influence physical adaptation, and what others have discovered can be found through exploring records, such as on the Internet.


But as far as humanity's active participation in information-space; it seems to me that there are some people that came to understand some important components of that thousands of years ago.


From that understanding; they developed civilization bending techniques involving weaponized fear, hyperbole, repetition, and deception (including deception by omission, and outright lies and/or truths given for the purpose of misleading).


Some people have been deploying those information-space psychological manipulation techniques for thousands of years, to the serious detriment of human civilization.


Unlike readily available information about material-space factors, people engaged in information-space manipulation want for everybody else to remain __ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT__ about information-space factors, and to __NOT__ develop information-space defensive mechanisms and techniques against information-space gaming and exploitation.


""Man-made climate change"" is a prime example of information-space gaming and exploitation through the psychological manipulation of susceptible victims, by way of mind parasites.


Other examples go back thousands of years.",0

"# 1. Justice (Crime and Punishment Must Be Proportionate)

Justice is about balance. A punishment should fit the crime. When someone commits an extreme crime murder, for example they have taken an innocent life. Justice demands that their punishment be equally severe. If a murderer is simply kept in prison, they are still given the chance to eat, sleep, and live, while their victim has lost everything.

This is why we punish crimes differently. A thief does not get the same punishment as a murderer because the harm caused is not the same.

The death penalty exists not as revenge, but as a way of upholding justice. Without it, the scales of justice remain unbalanced.

# 2. The Death Penalty Is Not the Same as Rape or Torture

You argue that we do not rape rapists or torture torturers, so we should not kill killers. However, there is a key difference: rape and torture are inherently immoral acts.

 They inflict suffering for the sake of suffering. The death penalty, on the other hand, is not done for pleasure or cruelty it is done as a legal punishment for the gravest of crimes.

Prisons, too, involve taking away a person’s freedom but we do not say that jailing a kidnapper is the same as kidnapping. Punishment and crime are not always the same thing.

# 3. Emotions vs. Practicality , The Role of Deterrence

You argue that the death penalty is based on emotions rather than logic. But the reality is, emotions are present in every part of the justice system. 

The fear of crime, the grief of victims, and the need for closure all influence laws. This does not mean that laws are irrational.

# 4. The Risk of Studying Criminals Instead of Punishing Them

Your idea that criminals should be studied instead of executed is interesting but raises ethical concerns.

 What happens when people start treating criminals as mere subjects for experimentation? Do we start keeping them in special prisons just to study them like lab rats? And what if they refuse to participate? Would forcing them to submit to brain scans and psychological tests not be another form of injustice?

Furthermore, criminals are already studied. Psychologists and criminologists interview them, analyze their behavior, and examine their past. The justice system should serve society by preventing crime and ensuring safety, not by turning prisons into research labs.

# 5. Fairness and Bias is A Separate Issue

 concerns about racial and gender bias in sentencing are valid, but they are not arguments against the death penalty itself. If there is bias in sentencing, the solution is to reform the system, not to eliminate a punishment that may be necessary for justice.",0

"I'm saying third party perspective of Genesis because....

Think of it logically!!!

What exactly is Genesis?

The first chapter is called ""The Fall""

Doesn't it sound like it begins in the middle of something? Like in the middle of chaos, darkness, destruction and there is nothing.

It's a clear polemic against the dominating dogma of the time - the Babylonian epic and their pantheon of Mesopotamian Gods - Sumerian, Phoenician, Egyptian gods which speak of absolute chaos and terror.

And in comes Genesis and offers a polemic:  
Hey, it's not chaos, the God Elohim Most High is actually a good God and he creates everything in order and there is no chaos.

Eden is his prototype.

But why? We need a polemic of the Genesis account itself to answer the question:

WHAT ARE THE MOTIVATIONS OF THIS GOD TO CREATE THIS PROTOTYPE IN HIS OWN IMAGE?

Was their kind in decline or facing extinction? What caused it? Did they need to create Eden to perpetuate their civilization? Mike Heiser vaguely tends to this.

The heat will build slowly, peaking through the weekend and into early next week as a warm and humid air mass blows in from Europe.

"You'll have LOTS of options.

I will give you a couple of warnings though.

The level of incompetence in this field is unmatched pretty much anywhere in any other sector. You will work with, and be employed by common people who don't get it and don't have the brains to ever get it full stop because many of the problems are non-linear and dynamical in nature which only a specific need of people that have a postgraduate in physics or applied mathematics or aeronautical engineering could really ever understand. The likelihood of coming across those sorts of people in the wild is extremely small. You just have to ask the general population do they know any one of those people and almost all of them will say no come on or only be able to real off one of maybe 200 friends.

Secondly, this level of incompetence bleeds into the sustainable consultancy space. And this means that you will be competing against people who are themselves utterly incompetent but otherwise very nice people a. And they build community at 10 to 20 times the rate that you can build followers. This is something you'll also see even on social media. Some of the most competent people in the cross of data science and climate spaces have extremely small followings because people do not understand them.

Thirdly, there are plenty of situations where your skills will be useful and not just at the primary level of data work.

I'll give you this one example that incorporates climate variable into health-economic assessment of drugs and medical devices full stop this is an introductory paper which then builds into four other papers that's include more dynamical system work.

The baseline of making this work in practise, especially to automate decision-making or decision support, is data science.

"Ok I concede that maybe I went too far by asserting the browness of a work to be intrinsic to the work itself, but you can’t deny that even if there’s a contingency on time period and culture, certain works are still less accessible given a fixed time period and culture than others. For instance, Netflix shows are ubiquitous in modern day US but Greek plays are something you’ll only really encounter in a lit class for the uninitiated.

Plus there has to be a reason Shakespeare withstands the test of time. His plays while accessible also infused deep meaning and commentary. Your argument is sort of an example of survivorship bias since there were probably also many many plays, books, and other works even in the 1600s that were just one trick ponies and didn’t survive till today to be relevant.

Dems can come back easily by shifting tones and embracing transparency and the new media environment. They have to be okay with sitting down for 2-3 hours interviews. They have to be okay with not parsing every word. Voters are forgiving when you talk like a normal person, and make mistakes. Dems try to be too polished then when they inevitably screw up, they get called out as hypocrites.

And the focus needs to be on jobs (talk about bringing manufacturing jobs without the need for tariffs), economic growth, and reforming health care (see UHC). Traditional social issues need to be minimized or entirely reframed. 

Don't be the party that defends bureaucratic rules. Voters want to reform and streamline government. Come to the table with ideas. For example, if climate change is really existential, you need to bring reform that speeds up the process for transmission line approval. You can't say it's life and death and go along with a 7 year cycle to get one new project approved.

"This is a great illustration of where Zionism and Judaism do not overlap, and I appreciate that you've given some examples of figures within the Israeli government that demonstrate you have a very good understanding of the political situation there. Also nice to hear the thoughts of a Jew in the diaspora.

 Adding your voice to the criticism of Israel does help de-fang people like Netanyahu who abuse the accusation to deflect criticism and bully the press. It does happen, I do not disagree with that

I would put forth on the other hand that I also have seen plenty of examples of anti-semitic bad actors who use ""Zionism is not anti-semitism"" in bad faith in order to silence or bully people who rightfully call them out as a wolf in sheep's clothing. Without a doubt, groups who have no interest in the fate of the Palestinian people but are only invested in this conflict to see a weakening or end of Jews regardless of where they live have co-opted the otherwise valid and overall agreeable side of this discussion critical of Israel, the Likuds, and Zionism as a whole. They are a minority, I do not intend to claim that the large outcry against Israel's actions in Gaza is the result of astroturfing or botting, but there is certainly a degree of information warfare being played on social media platforms surrounding this event

&gt; Therefore, as a US taxpayer and a Jew, I hold Israel to a higher standard than I would any country other than the US. Is that antisemitism or simple logic and reason?

I don't feel that this perspective is anti-semitic at all, and in fact I would go as far to say that I feel the same way about Israel. As a nation which expects itself to be treated as a peer by its Western Allies, it should be held to the same scrutiny which is why I am glad that the pushback against their starvation and genocide in Gaza has spilled over into the mainstream of US media

This point of view is not one which I implied in my original post is anti-semitic in nature. Due specifically to the nature in which words have been deliberately weaponized by interest groups and governments in regards to the Israel Hamas conflict, I tried to very carefully describe the specific rhetorical talking points that I see parroted mostly by the extreme end of those (rightly so) condemning Israel and it's genocide, and elaborate clearly on why I feel that these specific talking points are rooted in anti-semitism, and not legitimate discussion


I appreciate your comment here man. You've got great insight, and I hope you add your voice to discussions on this topic often, despite it often being a contentious environment to step into sometimes.",1

"&gt;Bribery, perjury, fraud, defamation are illegal and problematic because of other factors besides speech. Bribery is problematic because of what's done in direct exchange.

Doesn't matter. It's free speech. To quote you:

&gt;I think free speech means free speech.

So if corporations implicitly buying politicians being a problem isn't enough to limit free speech, neither is... corporations buying politicians explicitly. If you don't support legalizing bribery, defamation, fraud, and perjury, you don't support free speech. 

But if you're saying that there should be limits to free speech when free speech causes problems, you're just making the argument to overturn CU. 

So which is it? Free speech is free speech or it can be restricted by Congress?

&gt;Buying speech is, included in speech is, traditionally, the printing press, and in modern times, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos and ads, etc.

"The problem isn't just about stealing from individual artists - it's about systematically undermining the entire creative economy that working-class artists depend on. Even ""throwaway"" uses contribute to normalizing AI art and making it harder for artists to make a living.

When you grab a random image from Google, at least that image was created by someone who chose to put it out there. AI art is different - it's trained on artists' work without their consent, often scraping their entire portfolios including pieces they specifically chose not to make public or free.

Think about it like fair trade products. Sure, buying one coffee from an exploitative chain ""just this once"" might seem harmless, but it's the collective impact that matters. Every time someone uses AI art instead of hiring an artist or properly licensing work, it pushes us closer to a future where creative work is devalued and automated.

The whole ""it's just for personal use"" argument is exactly how big tech companies justify exploiting workers - by making unethical practices seem normal and inevitable. We should be fighting against this corporate takeover of creative spaces, not enabling it.

I've seen first-hand how many talented artists in my local scene have had to take corporate jobs because they can't compete with ""free"" AI art.

As someone who chooses to maximise their carbon footprint, I believe the sooner society collapses, the better it is for the natural world.

I care about these fruit flies and do not want them to suffer, but I know the population will collapse as soon as I remove the food source - my pets require only feeding every other week. So I trap fruit flies to prevent them from breeding and causing more suffering down the line, minimising the net suffering.

"Liberalism ≠ the center left moderate politics of American Democrats. It’s a much broader ideology, which includes *most* Democrats and *most* Republicans.

Per Wikipedia, Liberalism is defined as: 

&gt; Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty, consent of the governed, political equality, the right to private property, and equality before the law.[1][2] Liberals espouse various and often mutually conflicting views depending on their understanding of these principles but generally support private property, market economies, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, economic and political freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion.[3] Liberalism is frequently cited as the dominant ideology of modern history.[4][5]: 11 


Different factions within mainstream American politics espouse different aspects of liberalism to different degrees at different times (democrats in the modern era are *more* geared towards social equality, while republicans are more geared towards private property rights), but all parties generally operate in the same *value framework* of liberalism.

The supposed examples you cite of illiberalism still upheld liberalism, just in different degrees and in different ways. For example, Jim Crow was justified through appeals to Private Property rights and “States rights”, both nominally liberal values. While McCarthyism and Vietnam were justified as upholding liberal economic order, as opposed to the non-liberal socialist economic system.

Furthermore, Liberal values around the free market, free speech, and private property have laid the justification for lobbying and superPACs as “free speech”, which has made lawmakers even more subservient to moneyed interest. Right to Work laws also appeal to Liberal values of free association - but also have strong capitalist interests backing them.

Musk has spent billions successfully brainwashing the right wing (especially young men), and it wasn’t until he severely fucked up that those brainwashed people became much more agreeable to the notion of him not being the person they thought he was. Thereby allowing them to get on board with activism against him (in other words, it became politically more convenient and the movement took off).

"While the issue of finding a common good is its own problem

I fundamentally disagree that its the best way to bring people together. I do agree its a good one if you can find one, but the more important solution is finding a way to get contentious issues out of ""one-size-fits-all solutioning"".

Non political Anecdote, at a job i worked at someone found themselves in the position of solution architecting, and decided we all needed to agree on the same tool, while we'd all had a personal choice on toolset before for a long time.   He had his reasons, but to keep it abstract they were mostly based on hypothetical benefits, and done so without consideration of the downsides or a cost-benefit analysis. But he had the power to force the issue. The result was two camps formed, and people who had never had personal issues with one another ended up hating each other.  (I don't care that you use tool A, but demanding I use it over my choice of Tool B causes me real problems)

So ultimately,  whether it be decentralization, or more opt in opt out paths built into some of our government functions would do far more to reduce conflict.

So many of my conflicts with political foes come down to the fact that if we believed in you do your way and i do it mine we wouldn't be foes on this issue.

\*Edit\*: Im adding a slight argument here just to head off a critique I can see coming. I'm aware that not all issues can be worked out this way, and that its possible different issues need different solutions, but I still hold that its a net benefit for every issue you can do it with, and not artificially being at odds outweighs the suggested common cause route for the purpose coming together.",0

In a nutshell, the scapegoat ritual in Leviticus 16:6-10 prescribes that (a) We take two goats (b) release one (c) sacrafice the other for remission of sin. Now look at Mark’s Barabbas narrative. Little known fact, Barabbas means “son of the father” and Jesus, of course, is a “Son of the Father.” The plot of the story is that (a) We have two sons of the father (b) One is realeased (Barabbas) (c) The other (Jesus) is sacraficed for remission of sin. Matthew understands the symbolism, as he redubs Barabbas “Jesus Barabbas.” The scapegoats were to be “not one white different” so in retitling the character his name is much more obviously similar to “Jesus Son of the father” to whom he is contrasted.",0

"Ice sheets have melted, ocean currents are changing... These aren't things that turn back easily. The last time the AMOC shut down (during the younger Dryass) it took several thousand years to stabilize again. The timescale correlates with the volume of water where deep water formation occurs, multiplied with the typical through flow. The equilibrium time of the AMOC is simply in the order of thousands of years. You can cross a threshold and chaotically transition towards a new equilibrium, like we are doing now, but then it's going to be a mess until you stop kicking it and let it reach that equilibrium, so to speak. I did a PhD on this sort of behaviour in the Mediterranean Sea over geological timescales. The ice sheets are even slower.

Regarding the other points: sure, we can restore ecosystems, but growing back an old-growth forest takes more than a human lifetime. De-extinction is cool on paper, but it hasn't actually been done successfully yet. Letting it restore naturally will take a similar amount of time as during previous mass extinctions, e.g. tens of millions of years.

An additional problem is that removing the excess CO2 doesn't undo the changes that have already occurred, nor does it restore the destroyed habitats.",1

"“You didn’t provide proof, provide proof that early Christians did not believe a physical jesus actually existed,”

I think the early Christian belief was that Jesus had a physical body and was a personal being. However, he was may not have been believed to have lived on earth but in the sky. A reasonable alternative being that he may have been thought of as having secretly lived among mankind undiscovered and in an unknown location, not one who interacted with or started the Christian church. There were other mythological messiahs from the time period that are said to live in the garden of Eden or secretly imprisoned under Rome.

“your entire argument fundamentally hinges on “even though the books assume he was physical and real, really he was never intended to be real and Christians messed it up in a single generation”. We need something showing that, otherwise its just made up fanfiction you are believing to justify the string of bred crumbs you laid out for yourself.”

Is it possible to ‘mess up’ in a single generation? Lazarus in Luke 16 is a fictional character in a parable whom God does not raise because raising Lazarus would not convince anyone. In John 11 Lazarus is a real person who *is* raised from the dead and *does* convince others to believe because of it. Leke and John were written within about a generation of one another, maybe less. The cross that Emporer Constantine saw that said “Go forth and conquer with this,” was originally only a dream he had, but just 25 years later it became a story where the cross appeared objectively the sky before Constantine’s whole army!

is there anything to show this is the case? Yes, my whole post is arguing this thesis is a better explanation of the evidence, hate to reiterate the OP arguments again.",0

There's no solution to this problem that involves more complex technology and more variety (i.e. more energy) that won't ALWAYS have an equal but different environmental cost. Batteries are my pet peeve because they encourage behavior usually facilitated by fossil fuels, using fossil fuels and lots of elements in their manufacture, through our collective delusion that they're ""rechargeable"", and I guess 5000 charges is better than one, but it's still a disposable battery. In addition, the weight of EV's and their unrestricted design means all kinds of new tires and tire dust, which, &lt;PM2.5, mimics proteins and enhances allergens along with killing fish. 

Batteries are a one-step fix for oil, that just changes where the oil burns. ""We don't want to burn it in our car"" ""let's use battery powered cars then"" rather than the important discussion ""how do we live without cars?""

Im not going to shill for technology like I believe we can build different widgets and dig ourselves out of this hole.

"**Does This Mean We Can’t Call It Genocide?**

No one is saying “don’t care about Gaza until a court says the G word” The suffering is real, the harm is extreme and there's a strong case for investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity. But conflating these with genocide too early can:

* Undermine the credibility of the claim
* Make legal accountability harder later on
* Distract from viable mechanisms for pressure and justice (like ICJ, ICC, or UN commissions)
* Allow opponents to deflect critique by arguing over definitions instead of responding to the actual suffering

**On the Brink?**

Your phrasing, “on the brink of committing genocide” is arguably more accurate than claiming a genocide is definitively underway. It reflects the trajectory, the warnings from genocide prevention experts and the moral and legal urgency of the moment without overstepping the legal threshold prematurely. The ICJ’s provisional measures order against Israel in the South Africa v. Israel case shows that the risk is serious enough to merit intervention, even though a finding of genocide hasn’t been made.

You don’t need to call it genocide to demand:

* An end to the killing of civilians
* Accountability for crimes committed
* Access for humanitarian aid
* And real movement toward political resolution

"You're factually wrong - you literally know nothing about Islam.

Early Islam under the Rashidun Caliphate wasn't even particularly ""Islamic"" as latest research suggests. I can't remember the name of the scholar who is the most prominent proponent of that view, his name escaped me. In general his argument is that earliest Islam was a much more inter-faith and syncretic practice which is why Islamic conquests were so swift and relatively bloodless and that is a fact confirmed by archeological evidence.

Islam has been made an Arab imperialist ideology only under the Umayyad Caliphate. 

As a result it was overthrown by Abbassid Caliphate centered in Persia which is when ""golden age of Islam"" begins. Then Turkic expansion from Asia begins, first Gokuturks come and close off Middle East causing Crusades, then Mongols destroy whatever is left and then Ottomans take over.

Throughout majority of Islam's history it was **not an Arab-dominated culture** with the exception of Arabic language which functions as a sacred language. 

Your argument makes as much sense as claiming that Latin America has been under Roman imperialism before 1963 because Catholic liturgy had to be done in Latin.

Arab states have disproportionate influence over Islam currently due to oil money being used in spreading general political influence via Islamic schools funded by that money. But that's a recent development as well and has no grounding in Islam per se.

"I’ve linked to the press release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JD042719

Abstract

On polar ice sheets, water vapor interacts with surface snow, and through the exchange of water molecules, imprints an isotopic climate signal into the ice sheet. This exchange is not well understood due to sparse observations in the atmosphere. There are currently no published vertical profiles of water isotopes above ice sheets that span the planetary boundary layer and portions of the free troposphere. Here, we present a novel data set of water-vapor isotopes (O, D, ) and meteorological variables taken by fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft on the northeast Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). During June–July (2022), we collected 104 profiles of water-vapor isotopes and meteorological variables up to 1,500 m above ground level. Concurrently, surface snow samples were collected at 12-hr intervals, allowing connection to surface-snow processes. We pair observations with modeling output from a regional climate model as well as an atmospheric transport and water-isotope distillation model. Climate model output of mean temperature and specific humidity agrees well with observations, with a mean difference of +0.095°C and −0.043 g/kg (−2.91%), respectively. We find evidence that along an air parcel pathway, the distillation model is not removing enough water prior to onsite arrival. Below the mean temperature inversion (200 m), water-isotope observations indicate a kinetic fractionating process, likely the result of mixing sublimated vapor from the ice sheet surface along with an unknown fraction of katabatic wind vapor. Modeled  does not agree well with observations, a result that requires substantial future analysis of kinetic fractionation processes along the entire moisture pathway.

From the linked article: 

For the first time, researchers have collected detailed measurements of water vapor high above the surface of the Greenland ice sheet. Their research, aided by a custom-designed drone, could help scientists improve ice loss calculations in rapidly warming polar regions. 

The findings were published March 14 in JGR Atmospheres.  

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Greenland lost about 55 gigatons of ice and snow between fall 2023 and fall 2024. The island is shedding ice for the 28th year in a row, and scientists estimate that it has lost more than 5 trillion tons of ice since 1992.  

The Greenland ice sheet contains about 8% of the planet’s freshwater, and its meltwater could contribute significantly to rising sea levels, changing ocean circulation and ecosystems worldwide.  

The majority of ice loss comes from large ice chunks breaking off from glaciers and the melting of surface ice and snow. Sublimation, the process of solids turning into gases without turning into liquids first, may also play a role. Prior studies have suggested that in some parts of Greenland, about 30% of summer surface snow could sublimate to water vapor.",1

"I am aware that there was a segment of Israeli society which sought to distance itself from the survivors of the Holocaust as they wished to view themselves as strong, and not be thought as ""victims"". Within this framework, a few historians have noted that in the decade or two following Israeli's independence that Holocaust survivors would have been seen as a weakness to the legacy of Israeli Jews, however that is nowhere close to being treated like shit and is a more complicated psychological phenomenon that can occur in victims of trauma.

Considering Mossad spent a great deal of money, time, and effort hunting fugitive Nazi's around the globe and dragging them to court in Israel for their crimes I don't think I agree that survivors were treated like shit. Especially given the context that these people's scale of what being treated like shit means would be astronomical, considering how the Germans treated them


Regardless, even if Israeli's did treat Holocaust victims terribly that is irrelevant to their existence as a state, and does not make them comparable to the Nazis. Simply having certain qualities in common with Nazi Germany does not validate a full comparison on all fronts

"I looked at this again and there is additional mistake in your maths. 10 % of 40E6 acre-feet is about 5E9 t and not 5E6 t as stated.
So we are looking at the energy to raise 5E12 kg a distance of 1 m.

E = mgh = (5E12 kg)(9.8 m/s²)(1 m) = **4.9E13 J** = 13611 MWh = 13.6 GWh

Now to look at the claim of multiple nuclear plants - we can use an old plant Westinghouse design with a nameplate output of 1246 MW and annually generates about 9000 GWh. 

Accounting for inefficient pumping, frictional losses, electrical loses, etc, let us say that half of that power is not used to impart useful mechanical power on pumping the water. The nuclear plant would be capable of pumping 5E9 m³ of water to a height of about 330 m.

Now without more information on where the water is actually coming from, it's hard to know what the difference in elevation will be and how much pumping would be required.

All of this is rather pointless because not only would it be a nightmare to engineer such a mega project, it would be politically impossible. No states have a spare 5E9 m³ of water waiting for California to easily take it. Further, the issue California has is with management of their water and not actually a lack of water.

They could import all the water they need, but it doesn't do anything to prevent forest fires. Turns out mountain sides do not care about how full a nearby reservoir is. If there isn't enough rain or there isn't artificial irrigation installed, the mountainside will burn just the same.",0

"I think some scenarios are more likely than others. There are plausible scenarios that do not contradict the limiting factors you raise.

For example : What do you consider a planet? What do you define as ""colonization""?

I agree that the case for Mars is actually pretty weak, at least in the next several centuries. However, there are scientific reasons to establish a research base there. Would a facility station like McMurdo Station in Antarctica count as ""colonization""? If not, then it's difficult to imagine an economic case for anything beyond a Martian McMurdo.

However, the solar system has tens of thousands of minor planets that are full of valuable resources and do not have deep gravity wells. With existing technology, it is not actually very expensive to land a spacecraft on these objects. Japan's Hayabusa 1 and 2 missions cost about $100 million each, and each visited multiple minor plants, including the first successful landing and takeoff. If there were a business case for it, this is easily within reach of a normal venture-funded company.

So, I think it's reasonable to suppose that whether or not humans make a major move into space depends on whether or not there is a business case to extract resources on asteroids. I think there is a plausible argument that there is. 

Even if space colonization is pursued by a bunch of amoral venture-funded douchebags, there are still positive scenarios that could evolve from their success. Letting billionaires build it is certainly not the ideal way to get there, but if humanity shifted a significant portion of its mining and heavy industry off of the surface of the earth, I think that's a win for humanity. I think it would be awesome if computer chips, batteries, solar cells and wind turbine motors were manufactured in space and arrive in capsules. We can toss the billionaires out an airlock and socialize the infrastructure at our leisure. 

Now, most of that industry would probably be robotic, but inevitably some humans are going to be required to fix the robots. If that scenario meets your definition of ""colonizing other planets,"" then I think it's both plausible and desirable.",1

"You do know that nuclear power has existed for 70 years and has only gotten more expensive for every passing year?

How many trillions in subsidies should we spend to try one more time? All the while the competition in renewables are already delivering beyond our wildest imaginations.

How about their contribution to Islamic theology that sanctions suicide ehen it is militarily useful? No, reasonable Iranians, religious or secular, are not going to rally behind the regime
2. It is true that innocents are going to die. Unfortunately, that's an unavoidable reality of any war. However, from what I've seen thus far - strikes are mostly surgical, with clear military objectives. I know it doesnt help innocent victims. But it is also not random violence. It is certainly not worse than the violence Iranians already suffer from their regime.
It certainly does not destabilise the middle east, as Iran itself has been a key driver of instability by sponsoring proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthies and by fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Oh, and the Yemenites that are experiencing starvation and a humanitarian disaster for a DECADE? Fuck them, I guess. Just let's not deal with Iran.
3. Diplomacy actually has failed. I don't know how long you've been keeping track but Iran has been negotiating in bad faith since day 1.

Here are some relevant excerpts:

&gt;Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of 2001 and 2007 IPCC report chapters, writing in a 2007 “Predictions of Climate” blog appearing in the science journal Nature.com, admitted: “None of the models used by the IPCC are initialized to the observed state and none of the climate states in the models correspond even remotely to the current observed state”.

&gt;Raymond Bradley, co-author of Michael Mann’s infamously flawed hockey stick paper which was featured in influential IPCC reports, took issue with another article jointly published by Mann and Phil Jones, stating: “I’m sure you agree–the Mann/Jones GRL [Geophysical Research Letters] paper was truly pathetic and should never have been published. I don’t want to be associated with that 2000 year reconstruction.”

&gt;Trenberth associate Tom Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research wrote: “Mike, the Figure you sent is very deceptive ... there have been a number of dishonest presentations of model results by individual authors and by IPCC …”

&gt;Wigley and Trenberth suggested in another e-mail to Mann: “If you think that [Yale professor James] Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp, then, if we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official [American Geophysical Union] channels to get him ousted [as editor-in-chief of the Geophysical Research Letters journal].”

&gt;A July 2004 communication from Phil Jones to Michael Mann referred to two papers recently published in Climate Research with a “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL” subject line observed: “I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report.

Many of the industry's big players, we found, invested in the credits, including [Shell ](https://www.dw.com/en/shell-wins-appeal-against-order-to-cut-emissions/a-70757648), Exxon, Total and BP. But Verbio's Schreiber was the only investor willing to talk to us. 

The project Schreiber purchased credits from was supposed to save more than 120.000 tons of carbon by collecting gas from an oil extraction site in China's Xinjiang Region. The gas would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere or flared – both of which are a major contributor to global warming.

The release or flaring of gas at oil wells is a major source of carbon emissions

That's why extraction — and not just consumption — of [fossil fuels](https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-big-oil-and-what-does-it-mean-for-the-climate/a-70737668) is a major source of carbon emissions. The German government designed its carbon scheme to incentivize companies needing to reduce their emissions to channel funds to projects abroad to help them invest in carbon-saving facilities or processes. 

Only new projects were eligible for the scheme. ",1

"I am not aware of further studies.

There is a documentary about the Three Mile Island accident, the company, some of the companies cover up, disparities in emissions monitoring quality, and finally the government coming on to get them to clean up their act.  They interviewed the towns people, many of whom openly discuss the cancers they have developed later in life.

Here is the Netflix trailer.

You can decide for yourself if the people were put in danger.



I am from the area by the way. Not the TMI town per se, not terribly far away either.  The broader area has experienced localized pockets of significant pollution, with superfund sites that have required clean up.  It is one of the down falls of the region unfortunately.

People do get sick from such events, and it can be delayed for a significant amount of time, 45 years type of time.  

I know two people who have developed the same fatal cancer that had unique and bizarre cell structures.  The cancer cell type, combined with the location, was a combination that was so atypical that the doctors were confused by it for the duration of the treatment cycle.

These two people lived near and industrial superfund sites, unbeknownst to them at the time.

Is this enough evidence to pin down environmental contamination as the root cause of both of their unique and identical cancer outcomes?  Doubtful it will have a sample size large enough to draw correlation.

Their town was also invested by the medical community as a cancer hot spot, similar to the town where TMI is.

When areas are being investigated as a cancer hot spot, people are getting the same cancers, that have unique biological make up, and the unique make up is the same for all the people, and there is a major environmental pollution issue there caused by and accident or neglect.  It certainly makes me wonder about a correlation.  It just seams so peculiar.",0

"Please do show me some experimental archaeologists EFFICIENTLY making 3D interlocking polygonal masonry out of granite or andesite.


You imply that i'm closed minded, but at some point ten years ago or so, i discovered information that completely changed my mind about these ancient structures.


Until that point, i had no idea about the 3D interlocking polygonal stuff, the serapeum, osirion, sun temple, puma punku etc or how sophisticated their construction really is. 


I have no doubt it took time to make these structures, but historical records show that the great pyramid was built in a timeframe that would have required a finished multiton block to be placed every few minutes. How does that work when it takes people days and many broken tools to get a few cm into a block?


At that rate, the pyramids would still be under construction.


People who make your claims also fail to explain things like the boxes in the serapeum, particularly the one where the lid has a partial cut.


How would we go about cutting a lid off a single block like that with primitive tools that leave cuts like those anyway? It has the appearance of a giant band or circular saw cutting through stone. 


Then the box still has to be hollowed out. How do you hollow out the box, make it all perfectly flat and polished to the point that the lid is nearly airtight without any gaskets?


Can you explain how that level of precision is accomplished?


No, you cant and you wont. Just like the 3D polygonal masonry. People have done interlocking FACES of polygonal stones without bothering to make the stones interlock internally, like the actual megalithic stuff does.",1

Two judges ruled that there was sufficient evidence that he was in MS13 to deport him. They did not rule that there was enough proof that he could be imprisoned.

I think 1-2 are kinda missing the point that I’m presenting a specific minimal argument for atheism here. You can disagree with other types of it but disagreeing with those isn’t necessarily a counter argument for atheism, they aren’t all the same.

3- I find the English in the later part of 3 about science too mangled to be comprehensible to be honest. But it seems to be arguing something against scientism?

I think we just have a hard disagreement here though. Kinda bluntly the Ad Ignoratum fallacy is kinda flawed when applied as blanket counter argument to the idea of a hypothetical. We can acknowledge that philosophically there is a large category of things which cannot be assigned any formal truthiness to them but practically people don’t treat the vast majority of this category as reasonable propositions on reality. I think kinda plainly that the supporting evidence for god, indirect or otherwise, is the same as any unsubstantiated hypothetical.

The fact that you can form the shape of a deity by asking “logical” questions about the origins of the universe is meaningless because there is no reason to suggest god over any number of other hypothetical explanations to the exact same questions. 

You discuss ambiguity and all these fallacies but the fundamental point is just that a claim which does not say anything concrete about the universe has no more justification for being valid than any other non concrete claim. They could all be true, but until you start having putting them into belief statements which are predictive of stuff in a different way than other statements then they have equivalent claim to being the truth. And passively we treat most of this category as ‘false’ or at least not worth believing in in any substantive manner.",0

"anything what is asking for enforcement i do think is not worth pursuing

wether or not a human being would want to lend a fellow human being a hand or some expertise or some time or some finances

those modalitities of individuals interacting with each other would be best handled on a one to one level or eventually on a recommendation level with the local community people assembly giving advise to its permanent residents how they 

could

help each other not create difficult to repay situations

i also do think there is one model of investment where the person giving finances into a project receives a share of that project together with voting priviledges as in becoming able to influence decisions in the project

but then again, i personally favor donation economy and universal forgiveness of all financial debts what would be a situation when no one would

want

to demand of anyone to pay back financial debts and everyone who would want to provide services and produce wares would find people who appreciate to enjoy those services and products given freely to them

and in turn the greater society would support those people enjoying to give, serve and provide to others by ensuring their acess to material ressources

"I've been an environmental activist (e.g. among other things I've given public lectures on climate change and been arrested for direct actions) and don't support geoengineering so may as well lay out my views.

1.  Actual ecology is hard, ranking among the most difficult scientific challenges we've encountered.  Even the most successful projects, like [MELISSA](https://www.melissafoundation.org/), while massively advancing our understanding, have yet to be successful at creating closed loop systems.  I think this highlights that while our technological innovation is phenomenal when narrowly focused on a specific question, we come up against a hard problem when that specific question is 'entangled' in more other questions than we are aware of.  We inch further towards (possible, eventual) success at understanding a closed loop ecology by discovering the unforseen consequences of our fixes for previous unforseen consequences and then starting again with fixes for them.  The successes we've achieved have been thanks to the power of iteration - being able to test and fail repeatedly until we make progress.  We just don't have a working approach to holism, which is why the concept is generally left with the hippies - science hasn't found a better approach (I'm aware of attempts by E. O. Wilson and others to try to lay out a map for exploring this, but they remain curiosities.  The problem is too hard, and generally scientists stick to paths where success seems possible in well practiced and understood ways).

A lazy reading of the above might dismiss me as 'anti-science' and not appreciate the nuance that I fully accept the remarkable achievements of the scientists, while also having an awareness of where and why they meet challenges.  It might be comforting to believe our capabilities are greater than they really are, painting the scientist as some kind of 'Gandalf in a lab coat' figure we can count on to get us out of trouble, but I think it's better we don't.

2.  Climate change may not even be the biggest problem we face, though it certainly acts as an accelerator for many others.  As you might guess from my interest in closed loop ecologies my real interest is ""sustainability"".  Sustainability means not failing.  Given a choice of flights you might well prefer the cheapest, fastest most comfortable one, but I doubt you'd choose that if the plane wasn't capable of sustaining flight.  Something that isn't sustainable is something that comes to an end.  Personally I'm invested in wanting to see ""human existence"" as sustainable (as a stretch goal we can add things like knowledge and civilization).  So the big picture stuff for me is how well our own closed loop ecosystem is doing.

[https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html)

That's one measure, identifying 9 boundaries capable of jeopardising human sustainability, and climate change is just one of them.  For me the biggie is ""biosphere integrity"" (shouldn't be a surprise by now).

OK, so when it comes to geoengineering...

We don't get to iterate.  Any understanding we might gain of unforseen consequences can't be applied.

I have full confidence that we can successfully answer the question ""Can we find ways to manipulate Earth's radiation budget?"" but my own question is ""How will manipulating Earth's radiation budget affect biosphere integrity?""

And I know that no-one currently has any idea how to even begin answering that question.  Literally all we can do is try it and see, and then iterate.... oops, we can't.  Oh well.

I think those wanting to try geoengineering are limiting themselves to narrow questions that have little to do with any understanding of broader sustainability.  It probably goes back to ""scientists stick to paths where success seems possible in well practiced and understood ways"" - if we narrowly frame a question we can pat ourselves on the back for being smart enough to achieve a narrowly framed success, and when it comes to addressing the 'holistic' stuff of how sustainable is our closed loop ecology, we're back to praying for Gandalf in a lab coat.",1

 Over the past few decades, China and the United States have taken drastically different approaches to their economies, and the results speak volumes.  

China focused on long-term investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology. They built high-speed rail networks, modernized cities, and lifted millions out of poverty. Their leadership prioritized national development, creating jobs and improving living standards for the majority.  

Meanwhile, in the U.S., wealth inequality grew as economic gains disproportionately benefited the wealthy.

"&gt;We are living through one of the greatest discrepancies of distribution of wealth in the history of the world. 

And it should be pointed out that the industry which perpetuates and accelerates that discrepancy has never been more powerful and ubiquitous. 

I had just written that for the first time in modern history the obscenely wealthy have increased their hoard almost entirely through propaganda and disinformation. Those have always been indispensable tools. Religion exists mostly to keep poor people grateful for their poverty....

But then it occurred to me that this brief, now lost, New Deal period when a robust, active middle class was nurtured and allowed to share more fully in the rewards of an economy has been an anomaly. Ancient history is the catalog of how far religious propaganda can go to convince people to starve, punish and abase themselves so that a few can have it all.

"Before I dig in a little, your argument against illegal immigrants is very close to my argument *for* an Open Borders immigration strategy (as in let them in without visas and let them stay, not removing checkpoints).  Not saying this to go against your last line, only as context to the rest of this comment.

I think the problem is that you're misunderstanding (and therefore misrepresenting) the pro-illegal-immigrant position.  Because the way I look at things, I'm convinced that the astroturfing you're talking about is happening with anti-immigrant sentiment instead!

&gt; Illegal immigration causes competition for housing and wages among the poorest Americans. It creates downward pressure on wages and working conditions.

&gt; They are pretty much exploited by default.

They are only exploited more than Work Visa immigrants *because they illegal*.  For those who come here to work, the ""illegal"" part isn't a choice - if they're working the farms they're not gun-runners or anything.  The ""pro-illegal-immigrant"" sentiment isn't that people want ICE to turn a blind eye.  They want those illegal immigrants *to be legal immigrants instead of deported*, which would royally fuck those businesses you think are spreading the sentiment.

&gt; Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enough

I agree, but that's a lower priority issue.  Immigrants on Work Visas go through a lot of hoops to work here under those terms and they are satisfied (and with a few annoying exceptions, not fearing deportation every day).

&gt; Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers more

But every single study says **immigration** provides a much clearer net benefit to the economy, without any sign of diminishing returns.  The problem with illegal immigration in this sense isn't that we lose control of the number and quality of immigrants, it's that immigrants can be exploited because we don't give them rights.  

Ultimately, the corporations are far better served being openly anti-illegal-immigrant because that is the path that keeps undocumented workers from reporting the continued exploitation.  There's only so much money the government can (or will) throw at deportation, and that spend has a diminishing return.  The only thing that will stop there being a large number of illegal immigrants in the US is for the US economy to fail or their local country economy to strengthen.  So yes, those exploiting them want them CONSTANTLY terrified of an over-equipped ICE just coming to separate them from their families.",0

If you go out into buildings that see a lot of visitor traction in the UK: hotels, resorts, HOSPITALS. Yes many hospitals don't have any cooling. Student accomodation has no AC. I was staying at a student accomodation in London last year, sleeping on top of the bed in underwear and still sweating because NO FANS, NO AC, windows that barely open and Victorian bricked housing in 34°.

You could theorise then that the “soul net” could simply be such a being harvesting energy for some purpose. Perhaps it’s something as boring as harvesting energy like we harvest light.

"&gt;The US will no longer be considered a credible country to be negotiated with

That is simply not true. Unfortunately we live in a might-makes-right world with the United States at its center. As long as we are as powerful as we are we will be a central figure in international diplomacy. Trump is doing his best to end that status but for now we have it.

&gt;Any other country even remotely concerned that the US (or any other power for that matter…) may invade them will immediately push to develop nuclear weapons as a means of national survival.

Unfortunately Trump and Putin have already ensured this with Ukraine. Russia showed that its conventional military might is pathetic compared the the US and NATO, yet it is allowed to continue the fight in Ukraine because we are afraid to step foot inside their borders. The World War III and funding scaremongering tactics on the United States public were extremely effective. Trump and Putin have shown that any nuclear armed country can invade a neighbor and will be successful in conquering them eventually as long as they are willing to put up the fight long enough.

We can no longer strategize with the idea in mind of preventing this world from happening. It is already here and we need to strategize accordingly.

"I'm curious about your political beliefs. A lot of anti-Trump people on the left have been vehemently in disagreement with your statements that the last 80 years were a golden age. Instead, they have consistently claimed that America is racist, broken, and fundamentally flawed, going all the way back to the founding of this country. Their judgment of more recent decades has been that the Boomers and capitalists built an economy for themselves, leaving Millennials, GenZ, and anyone not in the 1%, starving and unable to earn a living or buy a house. Remember ""Occupy Wallstreet""""? That was a left wing movement, and it consisted of people who mostly voted for Obama, and against Trump. I have been told again and again how capitalism and the free market is an evil system of exploitation, despite the fact that I agree that it has helped bring about the golden age that you're describing, with falling poverty.  
  
My point being, why are you criticizing Trump for bringing about the changes that the left and the unions (who were historically Democrats), support? I heard no one this angry when the Democrats wanted to increase worker protections and help get the blue collar unions what they wanted, which was their political stance for the last 30+ years.  Basically, if you disagreed with that too, it seems like you should have been complaining loudly about the anti-capitalists for the past several decades. Everyone is coming out of the woodwork to criticize Trump now, because it's socially acceptable within your circles. But there's no consistency in these criticisms.

On top of all of that, are you supporting the Tesla boycotts and recent firebombing protests? Because up until a few days ago, it was claimed that Tesla was ushering a new green era, as the premier EV company that was going to combat the climate change that you're worried about. So how can someone be simultaneously worried about the disasters of climate change and also support the destruction of one of the greenest companies out there?",0

"This is a compelling application of Popper’s theory, and I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful analogy. The idea that the purpose of democracy is iterative—testing and disproving political models rather than finding a perfect one—is a healthy and humbling perspective.

That said, my concern is that we’re no longer operating in a system where falsification is truly possible, because the experiment itself is rigged. We’re not swapping out sulfur and discovering phosphorus—we’re burning the same compound over and over again, just with new branding. In Popper’s analogy, the method only works if the inputs are changing based on new ideas. But in modern politics, especially within heavily entrenched two-party systems, we keep bouncing between the same frameworks with corporate interests pulling the strings in both cases.

The danger is that marketing—not merit—is what defines electability now. And when billion-dollar campaigns are powered by carefully engineered optics and manipulated public perception, we’re not voting based on “trying a new idea.” We’re voting based on which illusion was more effectively sold.

So yes, I support the democratic ideal of trial and error, but the current reality feels more like an echo chamber where dissent is minimized, alternatives are gatekept by financial barriers, and the same ruling class stays in power regardless of which puppet is on stage.

True democratic evolution can only happen when the full spectrum of ideas is allowed into the public consciousness—not just the ones that passed the corporate litmus test.",1

"I feel like this interpretation gives him too little credit for just how self-centered and evil he is. 

It's not that he legitimately believed the disease would cease to spread and affect people if we stopped testing/tracking the cases. Even he isn't that stupid.

Like most things with him, it was always about ego. He wanted to stop testing and tracking so that, in the 'official' numbers, it would look like the US was mostly unaffected and he was doing a good job. He was well aware that it would continue to spread through communities and kill many thousands, and he was also aware that not tracking cases would lead to less resources being devoted to the problem, exacerbating it even further. 

He was fully aware of all of this.

But to him, he was willing to make all those tradeoffs so that he could have 'official' figures lower than any other country's to parade around and use to stroke his own ego.

To boil all this down to him just ""being so stupid that he thought not testing would make it go away"" is too charitable for him. The entire thing began and ended with the goal of getting him some impossibly good 'official numbers' to self-fellate with on the world stage, consequences to the public be damned.

"Twenty miles outside Corpus Christi, Texas — an area so dry the local water company distributes shower timers at high school football games — the world’s richest man is nearly done building a lithium refinery that could require as much as 8 million gallons of water per day.

In a rare public update on the $1 billion project, Tesla Inc. in December said it was starting to test the ability to process lithium through the new factory. But the carmaker still doesn’t have a contract for the water needed to operate the facility, presenting a hurdle for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s goal of turning lithium into chemical products used to make electric vehicle batteries.

The factory, where Tesla aspires to start production this year, is part of a broader effort by Musk to ease bottlenecks and build a more robust domestic supply chain of the critical raw material. It has also set off alarm bells among some in the small Texas town who are worried about having enough water to live on, let alone help supply a big factory.

  
In 2022, Tesla estimated it would need 400,000 gallons per day to run the lithium plant, rising to 800,000 gallons per day at peak usage. Two years later, a Tesla employee told a consulting firm, Raftelis, that the forecast has spiked to as high as 8 million gallons per day, according to South Texas Water Authority records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request.

South Texas Water Authority controls the water but doesn’t sell it directly to Tesla, which is negotiating a water contract with Nueces Water Supply Corp., a water utility company. Nueces Water Supply didn’t respond to requests for comment. South Texas Water Authority didn’t provide a comment for this story.

It’s difficult to determine what kind of drain Tesla’s factory would have on the area’s water supply. But the average American family uses about 300 gallons of water per day or 109,500 gallons per year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

For Robstown, which had 3,804 households as of 2023, that would equate to about 1.1 million gallons a day. At the high-end estimate of 8 million gallons per day, Tesla would be using eight times Robstown’s average residential water use. That’s enough water to fill eight ten-foot-deep swimming pools that are nearly the size of a football field, according to the US Geological Survey.

Drought Levels
It’s always been dry in this hot corner of South Texas best known for its beaches and energy exports — but there’s even less water to go around today than when Tesla first broke ground in May 2023. The area’s drought status was just upgraded to stage 3 — urgent — meaning turning off non-essential water use across facilities and parks and adding new restrictions on washing cars, watering lawns and operating decorative fountains.

“They’re telling us to take shorter showers and turn the faucet off when we’re brushing our teeth,” said Marie Lucio, a resident of the nearby Lost Creek neighborhood. The area already has frequent problems with water quality, including low pressure and a milky-like tint, and she’s worried the area’s aging water pipes won’t be able to keep up with new demand like the Tesla factory. “We’re not equipped to handle getting water to these industries.”",0

"I have thought about how modern billionaires compare to ancient leaders. If you consider the ancient world when things went really bad the way leaders ensured loyalty was they led people into battle and their armies were loyal to them based on shared personal experience and suffering during war. Regardless of their merits as a leader people were willing to follow them because they were in front putting their lives on the line in the way they asked their armies to do. Today's billionaires would never do that. Their lives are built around insulating themselves from any form of inconvenience and if a battle were to ever break out around them they would do anything they could to run away from it as fast as they possibly could and everyone knows it. They have spent their lives being owners, not leaders of men like ancient rulers were when battles came. They want to continue on with the ownership mentality in what they imagine will be a post apocalyptic world, but if things really go as bad as they imagine they will have nothing to offer anyone. It's pathetic that they are trying to think up ways to get people to die for them when you know they would be wanting to make their soldiers sleep outside the bunker on day 1. If society does collapse no one will be dying for them and it sounds like they know it because thier money would be worthless and they have nothing else to offer. Even if they don't have their bunkers raided in the first week they are done as soon as the power goes off because none of them know how to function without a team who does everything for them. It's so dumb that some of these people who depend on their staff for all their day to day needs are wanting to kick off the collapse of society that enables their lives of luxury and they think they will be the ones who come out on top to lord over the wastelands.",0

Now, taxis are mostly history, and shared ride services are ubiquitous in cities. The same thing will happen to public transit on the periphery, nobody is going to wait for a 40-foot bus that shows up once an hour when for the same fare they can call a shared autonomous vehicle that will be there in less than five minutes. But this is not the end of public transit, autonomous vehicles will not compete with the core of the public transit system, subways, metros, light rails, even frequent bus service on busy corridors. It's just on the periphery, where the economics of current technologies can't provide a good service that autonomous vehicles will take over.",0

"&gt; You can see them lots in Facebook and X. People are writing negative stuff about Ukraine and Zelenski, and that they should give up on fighting.

Facebook, X and most other social media platforms represent what people think out in the real world because they don't have the horrifically biased censorship that reddit now has has across its biggest subs. 

Try posting anything anti-israel, anti-US or any articles exposing the evil shit our own countries do and you will get swiftly banned on most big subreddits and especially world news.  Post any news article from mainstream news that mentions our own countries breaking international law and you definetly will be brigaded and banned. 

Reddit is a heavily biased pro-censorship violent Liberal echo chamber. Literally almost any other social media platform is more balanced then this place. 

10+ years ago it wasn't like this. Reddit use to love whistleblowers, free speech and white hat hackers but now they hate them.  This place is brigaded by militant aggressive liberals who believe that burning shops/cars/cities, doxing thousands of people and death threats is a good thing. They believe that anyone right wing deserves to die and will tell you that in the comments.

They are what the right wing was in the 00's. They would have fully supported the Iraq war and hated the whistleblowers who exposed that war for what it was, a big lie sold to us by our own media and all to get our hands on a countries resources.

"Did these pre-modern states truly have the concept of sovereignty in the modern sense that we are talking about? The second book you cited even discusses the Sui and Tang dynasties dating back to 1500 years ago. This is as absurd as using customary law from the Frankish period to define issues from the colonial era.

The Qing Dynasty was a period of transition for China from a pre-modern state to a modern state. By the late Qing era, it had begun to shape its national identity in a modern sense, modeled after Western countries. In the treaties and maps of the same period, you will find that both the Qing government and the international community regarded Tibet as sovereign territory of the Qing Dynasty.

The Tibetans themselves did not make this kind of modern identity building. You can regard Tibetan independence as a claim, but until it signs an agreement with the suzerain (probably through a rebel war), such an independence is unlikely to be recognized.

&gt;Well if the USA doesn't exist, then the PRC has even less reason to, given the PRC is 176 years younger than the United States. Both are young countries. Just as the US is a successor state of the British empire but not the British, likewise the PRC is (one of the) successors of the Qing empire, but not the Qing.

That's why I said your ""historically Tibetans were separate culture/society that the Chinese often warred against."" is meaningless. If we use this kind of proof, any modern countries should not exist.

In the [Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Edict_of_the_Abdication_of_the_Qing_Emperor), the last Qing emperor explicitly stated the transfer of sovereignty, including the Tibetan region, to the Republic of China.

You seem to feel that internal justification removes morality. This is not the case.

I said we can ignore cognitive disabilities as long as we prove the presence of one individual who is good or evil without them, or present an argument that all evil people have such a cognitive disorder. This removes any reasoning around ""are they evil because of their disorder"". We just need one example of a person without one, and your proposition is false. A rapist is such an example - they don't all have cognitive disorders, some of them are just normal people who thought that their horniness and possibility of getting away with it trumps someone else's freedom and health.

There are people on the Internet who will hack or trick their way into access to your money, and then will take everything they can get their hands on.

&gt;It's unfair to cats because they don't want to have their balls chopped off, its not natural. What if aliens came to earth and started chopping our balls off

&gt;Maybe it makes them live longer, but again it's not fair to chop their balls off because of emotional attachment

&gt;I heard another reason to neuter cats is so they dont reproduce and overpopulate, but that to me just sounds so dystopian, stopping cats from reproducing? It's just all do unnatural and unnecessary

&gt;The only reasons (that i know of) to neuter a cat is so they dont overpopulate, so they don't spray and so they live longer. To me all of those reasons are bad reasons

What do you mean it's not natural?

I've heard a (male) vet say society would be improved if we neutered human men, so presumably the aliens would be on to something..

It reduces diseases like cancer. It makes THEM happier. They are not combative and aggressive over nothing. They do not go into heat (I'm just ignoring your sexist segregation). They are calmer and happier, live longer, are less prone to several diseases.

If anything, given lizards on earth are still tiny, it’s likely that APES used some lizards genetics to develop themselves, otherwise it doesn’t make sense for a species to be conquered and left alone in the midst of development when we can war against them and destroy their food source. 

We as HUMANS study genetics and look at those closest to REPTILES and have found that reptiles retain reptilian form because they aren’t comfortable, not because they are comfortable.

"""NOBODY"" ??? is happy with electric cars.

I am.... I love my electric car... very happy with it. Absolute dream to drive. ICE vehicles are like horse and buggy and this is a futurology subreddit... not a history subreddit. 40 minutes to fill up, ok cool but most people plug their cars in at home and generally leave the house with a full tank of energy.  For the majority it is closer to 0 minutes to fill up rather than 40 minutes. The people that don't have that kind of convenience work their lives a little smarter with their car.  They will plug in at the shops and go shopping and come back to a topped up car. That = 0 minutes waiting to fill up.  And 0 minutes is better than 5 minutes.

People obviously get in situations where they have to wait 40 minutes. Road trips are the obvious one but I just did one. Drove 300km's and stopped for subway sandwich for breakfast while my car was charging. Once I was done eating and had a walk around and a stretch, the car was ready to go.

And the edge cases of people having problems managing their car charging and complaining about it are people that clearly can't manage their situation. It really isn't that hard and if you are in a life situation where it's hard to charge your EV... then maybe just maybe don't buy an EV.

Anyway this post sucks because you are ignorant and those type of people suck.

But you might be right about a car future. I believe the future of car usage will actually see car ownership DECLINE. How does that manifest?  Fleets of self driving electric vehicles that will either be driving from job to job or sitting at the huge depot charging up. Want a car for the weekend road trip? Unlock it from the fleet and hire it.  What is the point of a vehicle just sitting around at the office car park for 8 or 9 hours?  

I reckon there will be less cars in the vehicle ecosystem and more efficient use of the ones out there. Basically the average time a car is driving will sky rocket.",1

You consider the difference between the \~4K of the universe and the thermometer measurement as being caused by the greenhouse effect. But instead, what the IR thermometer - likely - measures, is the temperature of a particular volume of gas in front of it.

If the IR thermometer is based on a thermopile, it takes the average of energy emitted by gases in front of it, and converts the related current to a temperature based on very inaccurate black body assumptions and Stefan-Boltzmann equations, which do not hold for gasses. But in essence, it is a crude temperature measurement of gas. Not a transmission measurement.

If the IR thermometer is based on a semiconductor detector, such as an avalanche photo detector, it measures in a particular MIR or LWIR window. It then measures the temperature of a specific gas in front of the thermometer. Again, this has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect.",0

to me it feels like we as a society dont go to the roots to find out what is wrong on a systematic level but stay on the surface and spend enormous amounts of finances to make people richer who allready have more money than really would be good for them

in this case what is discussed in the article, i see the sollution with the people assembly of the local community what is most nearly affected by it respectivly also all the local communities in the region what would be affected by it when water would enter the not fully sealed mine shafts having the toxic waste in them

i do not agree with the court, police, military and political hierarchy system

what affects the lives of everyone would be best also decided by everyone without any representatives elected but yes by the people assembly listening to this that or the other expert giving his oppinion wether or not to take out the toxic waste now or later

from that little i read in that article its clear for me to take it out as soon as possible and surely the people in the affected region would be able to for example crowdfund the amount of money needed to do the remediation or even better withold paying taxes untill that remediation has been done and invest the money not payed to taxes for this remediation",1

"This seems like post fact reasoning because you can’t accepting reality that nuclear power simply is horrifically expensive.

We attempted to scale nuclear power 40 years ago. Nuclear power peaked at **~20%** of the **global** electricity mix in the 1990s. [It was all negative learning by doing.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421510003526)

How many trillions in subsidies should we spend to try one more time? All the while the competition is already delivering beyond our wildest imaginations.

"I do agree video games do have a grifter problem, though i do find it very curious how you only mention right wing grifters and complaints, while not mentioning left leaning ones. It tips your hand.

But I’m not here to debate grifter politics. While gaming may have a universal grifter issue, they certainly aren’t ruining video games.

Game devs have made it very clear over the past years that they do not care about criticism, valid or otherwise. Long before “woke” was an overused word, devs dismissed criticism offhand due to “trolls,” “bigots,” and other dismissive labels.
Grifters and the like are a vocal minority, and yet even the vast majority of respectful and helpful criticism is labeled and put in the same boat.

No, grifters are not ruining video games, they profit from the ruination. As another commenter said, you can very easily ignore grifters. And grifters hold little power, the name grifter alone demonstrates that.

No, game devs and CEOs trying to please out of touch investors are ruining video games. Grifters didn’t force anyone to make Saints Row 5, or Veilguard, or Forspoken. And they certainly didn’t make people make the games how they are.

The issue is that game devs and CEOs have ignored valid criticisms time and time again, falsely labeling critics as trolls or phobes or what have you to shut down criticism. No wonder gamers are angry and flock to grifters, they (grifters) prey upon the problems game devs have made by ignoring and ostracizing their audience.",0

"I think ""huge problem"" is overstated.

This is oversimplifying, but... let's say I put solar panels on my house.  And I generate all the power I need during the day, even store some at night.  But at peak time, 4pm, when the sun is still out, batteries are fully charged, there's some energy that's now unused, and ""lost.""  And maybe my battery runs out by 5am, and I need to use grid power from 5-6 until solar kicks back in.

Is that ideal?  No, of course not.  But is it a ""huge problem"" for me?  No, of course not.  I'm still covering 23 hours of my power use with solar, and while I'm ""losing"" some of that power, it's not like its wasted, there's no fuel or resource being used up.

And as other posters have pointed out, this is kind of what you want, right?

You don't build batteries when there isn't enough power, there's no point to them.  You build out power, then when you have excess, it's really easy to make the case to spend the money to build battery storage.  That's where they are now, with a very clear case for spending that money to build out storage.

"&gt; Anthropic CO2 emissions are not going down, plateauing nor their increase is slowing. Every year we're not only emitting more than the previous one, but the increase year on year is getting larger.

[The data shows the year on year increase is rapidly declining.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?time=2003..latest&amp;country=~OWID_WRL)

That's the curve of global emissions over the last 21 years; from there we can look at the *increase* in emissions each year.  It's a somewhat noisy dataset, so I'll break it into 5-year intervals:  

 * 2004-2008:  +0.88 Gt/yr  
 * 2009-2013:  +0.65 Gt/yr  
 * 2014-2018:  +0.29 Gt/yr    
 * 2019-2023:  +0.21 Gt/yr    

i.e., the average increase over the last 5 years is only 1/4 the average increase over the mid-2000s, and the average increase over the last 10 years is only 1/3 the average over the prior 10.

Since [China's rolling 12-month average emissions is in decline](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-record-surge-of-clean-energy-in-2024-halts-chinas-co2-rise/) thanks to the *massive* growth in clean energy and EVs they're seeing, and since [the world other than China had declining emissions over the last 5 years](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?time=1982..latest&amp;country=IND%7ECHN%7EOWID_WRL), there's a solid chance we'll see that decline in the rate of increase not only continue but turn into an outright decline in emissions themselves.

***

Regarding atmospheric CO2, interestingly, [their observations from Mauna Loa do not show the same trend](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/gr.html), and in fact show a *decrease* in the growth amount in 2024.  However, the Mauna Loa increase for 2023 is larger than their global one, so the *sum* of the two is much more similar (6.69ppm for Mauna Loa vs. 6.49ppm for global) -- the Mauna Loa site had its big jump the prior year.

Overall, these increases are *very* noisy -- the global average had a big drop in 2017, for example, and a *massive* jump over 60% larger than last year's in 1987 -- so it's a mistake to attach too much weight to a single year's value.",1

"I think the argument is if we want to reduce emissions 1st step is to electrify as much as possible and supply it with renewable power.

Steel and concrete. Shipping and aviation. So there's efforts to address those too, and they're all necessary to understand. The SAF approach is probably the easiest short term option because it's scalable, tho not economical, with basically existing technology. But that leads to companies putting token small invests into it to tout their ""sustainability"" while unwilling to divest from fossil reliance on any meaningful scale, mostly because the consumer demand for cleaner options doesn't make up for the added cost- nobody will pay for it. I still think it's valuable to develop and understand the tech tho, even though there's no real chance of large scale adoption unless we can put a rela dollar sign to the impact of unchecked emissions",1

The US is the world’s leading oil producer. We are extracting more fossil fuel per year than any nation in history.

"[The last 3 paragraphs in this comment mention plausible reasons why Trump recently and publicly threatened to invade Greenland.]   
    
&gt;An international team of scientists has found that [global heating](https://www.ecowatch.com/freshwater-lakes-surface-oxygen-loss-climate-change.html) has, over the past two decades, melted enough of [Greenland’s glacial ice](https://www.ecowatch.com/greenlands-melting-ice-vegetation-wetlands-rock.html) that 1,006.6 more miles of coastline have become exposed.  
         
&gt;“Accelerated climate warming has caused the majority of marine-terminating glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere to retreat substantially during the twenty-first century,” the authors of the [findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02282-5) wrote in a paper published in _Nature Climate Change_.    
           
&gt;The researchers described how they tracked the receding glaciers by comparing Northern Hemisphere satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. They used the images to track the [exposure of Greenland’s coastline](https://phys.org/news/2025-03-global-exposes-kilometers-greenland-coastline.html) as ice flows heading toward the sea became smaller, reported Phys\.org.  
    
&gt;“We identified a total of 2,466 ± 0.8 km (123 km a−1) of new coastline with most (66%) of the total length occurring in Greenland,” the scientists wrote in the findings.  
          
&gt;The melting glaciers revealed 35 islands that had been obscured by ice until recently, 29 of which are part of Greenland.  
      
&gt;The scientists noted that 13 of the newly exposed islands have not yet been recorded on a map, meaning they have not been claimed by any nation. The discovery could lead to “jockeying” by countries set on accessing potential natural resources the islands could contain.   
          
&gt;The retreat of the glaciers poses a risk to local communities in the coastal zone. Regions surrounding marine-terminating glaciers are more susceptible to tsunamis triggered by landslides, the researchers said.  
           
Beneath the body of text content in the article, a link goes to a video entitled “Why Greenland? Remote but resource-rich island occupies k...” The webpage where the video is located includes a text section beneath the video window, which includes the following text:

&gt;ASSOCIATED PRESS

&gt;“Well, because it's the intersection of climate change, resources, economics and geopolitics. So what does Greenland have? It doesn't have much people, 57,000. But what it does have buried underneath that ice, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, is a lot of oil, billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. And even more important, it has rare earth elements that are needed for things in telecommunications like your cell phones. Right now, we get much of that from China.”

Also on our 50x50 that is no tomatoes,peppers or fruit other than strawberries. We live north enough that we need a green house to get tomatoes and peppers consistently so that means a greenhouse, plus having a setup in the house to grow seedlings.

The metallic hydrogen stuff is almost certainly also fraudulent, and has all the same telltale signs from the superconductivity stuff.

I would also suggest that St Louis is a decent approximation of median American weather, so it's common for Americans to have experience of 0F.

Turning back to the CMV, I think it is reasonable to say that the 0-100F scale provides better coverage of the range of temperatures typical Americans experience than the 0-100C scale. Whether that provides an argument in favor of F is a matter of opinion. These are, after all, just two series of numbers.

Were I to try to make such an argument, I would say that I've lived with both F and C thermostats, and I find the F thermostat to be more useful. Americans typically have the sense that 72F is ideal temperature. Europeans typically say 20C is the ideal temperature. This feels more like ""this is a round number"" than actual ideal temperature to me, and I think the temperature scale is a factor in this.",1

The time when a difference could be made in the future will never end until humanity is extinct; we will experience negative consequences from climate change, this has been true since the 70s.  We are still determining, and will continue determining how bad those consequences will be, due to our continued output.  The species and life on earth is not guaranteed to go extinct; we are guaranteed to see a harsher world where the more marginalized face greater harm, and every degree of warming further exacerbates that.

plus if your going to argue - perhaps read the links and associated papers - they also use beryllium in ice cores to match against radiocarbon in the tree rings 

""Radiocarbon, or carbon-14, is an isotope of [carbon](https://www.livescience.com/28698-facts-about-carbon.html) with extra neutrons and is produced when [cosmic rays](https://www.livescience.com/cosmic-rays) hit nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. High radiocarbon levels in a tree ring suggest there was a spike in cosmic rays around that time. The time the spikes occurred in these rings matches findings from ice cores that were recently unearthed in Greenland, which showed high levels of the element beryllium from the same period. Beryllium is most commonly created by cosmic rays slamming into the nuclei of other elements. Researchers think the radiation spike came from a massive solar storm, most likely triggered by a fast-moving cloud of magnetized plasma and radiation known as a [coronal mass ejection](https://www.livescience.com/what-are-coronal-mass-ejections) (CME) that was launched into space by a humongous [solar flare](https://www.livescience.com/solar-flares). ""

"Better? The adavantage of something like Ground News comes from the fact that the analysis is systematic. The methods are transparent and their analysis is applied similalry to all news sources, whatever the source. This means that the results are far less biased that a Google search. Much like science, there is value in repeatability.

Ground News identifies media outlets that consistently show biases, using several independent sources. If a media outlet allows many different perspectives on different topics as you suggest, they would ultimately be rated as relatively centrist in their views. The only way that an outlet would be labeled as biased to the left or right would be if they consistently show bias on a wide range of topics. 

In my experience, most people are not very good at recognizing bias because we all bring our own perspectives. One way to overcome this is to intentionally seek out different perspectives on a topic. When I've personally conducted such activities, I've learned to better recognize my own biases. Part of the reason our culture is divided is that people live in their own media bubbles. People would better understand the complexities of most issue if they seek out divergent perspectives, particularly when it comes to editorial interpretations of the facts.

Even with striclty factual reporting, there is the issue of errors of ommission. Biased publications with extreme left of right views often chose to leave out facts that color events in a way that is inconsistent with their ideology. Intentionally chosing to read topics from different perspectives yields a more complete understanding of the underlying facts. It also helps understand the spin being used by politicians making it easier to identify the BS and counterpoints. Sure, this could be done independently, but services like Ground News makes this process more efficient.

Your oil industry example actually highlights another potential value because publications with consistently biased views should not be trusted to provide truly unbiased coverage on any issue. Sure there may sometimes publish reputable reporting on some topics, but it still behooves one to look at all stories with a higher degree of skepticism. If I don't have the time or interest to take a deep dive on a particular topic, then I can avoid publications who are consistently biased altogether and intead use media outlets who make efforts to be unbiased. Sometimes we simply don't have time to read multiple articles on particular news event. 

Finally, I disagree with your 2 minute time estimate because one cannot sift through the biases in the content of articles without fully reading all articles. Headlines are designed to get clicks and often have little to do with the actual content. How many times have you seen dozens of opinions expressed on Reddit where it is obvious that people did not read the article in questions? This is roughly the equivalent of a quick and dirty search that a two minute search would generate.",1

"In the case of this question it gives the correct answer

&gt;If all of the ice on Greenland and Antarctica were to melt, how much would that raise sea levels?

&gt;&gt;If all the ice on Greenland and Antarctica were to melt completely, it would cause a significant global sea level rise:

&gt;&gt;Greenland Ice Sheet: ~7.4 meters (24 feet)

&gt;&gt;Antarctic Ice Sheet: ~58.3 meters (191 feet)

&gt;&gt;🌊 Total Potential Sea Level Rise:
~65.7 meters (~216 feet)

-----

Edit, I asked ChatGPT to find the mistake:

&gt;I think that I have an error in my math calculating sea level rise from the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets

&gt;Total amount of ice is 30 million km^3
&gt;Total area of oceans is 361 million km^2

&gt;Million and k in a division are just zeros, so we can scratch them out:

&gt;30 m^3
&gt;361 m^2

&gt;30/361 = (rounded) 0.1 meters 

&gt;&gt;Your approach is almost correct in that you can cancel out the ""million"" factors, but the error comes from the remaining units. Here’s the step‐by‐step explanation:

&gt;&gt;**Volume and Area Given:**

&gt;&gt;Ice volume: 30 million km³

&gt;&gt;Ocean area: 361 million km²

&gt;&gt;**Cancel the Millions:**
When you cancel “million” from both numbers, you’re left with:

&gt;&gt;30km^(3)/361km^(2)
 
&gt;&gt;Resulting Units:

&gt;&gt;Dividing km³ by km² gives you km:

&gt;&gt;(30/361)km≈0.0831 km

Indeed. I used to work for a company that installed utility scale battery plants. They are excellent for grid stability. This is being done and needs to be done more. Most people have the misconception that batteries equal storage. As though they would keep everything running when there was an outage. That is not how they are used. They smooth out transients in the grid and clean up the power being sent preventing brown outs and surges. They are the equivalent of having a near instantaneous power plant switching on line as needed. Where fossil fuel power plants have to be maintained while down and have to ramp up before they can switch on line.,1

"I think you are misunderstanding what exploitation means, at least in the sense that Marx meant it. It is the exploiter that Marx and the rest of them wished to be rid of, not necessarily exploitation in the broad, dictionary sense.

Say you work in a pencil factory. It costs $0.50 to make the pencil, excluding your labor. You make 100 pencils per hour. The pencils sell for $1 each. So, your labor produces $50 of profit per hour. But wait! The guy who owns the factory takes $30 of that profit, leaving you with only $20 per hour.

You can meet your needs at $20/hour. But you're still being exploited by the guy who owns the pencil factory, since he's collecting the profits of your labor (as well as those of your coworkers) without putting in any labor himself. The owner of the factory owns your labor, which makes you more of a machine than a human being. That's the exploitation that we want to be rid of.

"&gt;God in the OT was one of the angels - ""The Lord God said, 'The man has now *become like* one of *us* because he understands good and evil. So *we* must not let him take *fruit* from the tree that gives life"" Genesis 3:22 This would imply he/she/they are one of many, and must either be talking to themselves or another God, or Angel, or Entity.

God is talking about the Elohim, of which He is a part. God is a spiritual being, the first spiritual being. God then Created other spiritual beings, which are still of the same class, but lesser. God is talking to the other Angels about man's fate.

There are many Angels (elohim), but there is 1 prime 'Angel', God, which Created all the rest.

&gt;God did create evil - didn't God create everything?

I've already anwsered this. God didn't Create evil, he Created free will, which some of the angels and humanity used to do evil. The distinction is clear...

As for the verse you quoted, I haven't even checked it, because i've been through these motions countless times, I'm gonna assume it's exactly what you've posted:

In the original Hebrew, it probably reads something like: ""God Created the ability to do evil""', which is the same thing I'm saying here.

Satan/Lucifer/Gadreel is evil, he's pretty much the definition of evil in Scripture, the fallen one (s), there's obviously other fallen Angels aswell.

God Created him, so therefor God is evil?

Essentially your point of view leads to: everything anything  or anyone has ever done is God's action and responsibility.

To which I disagree. I am my own person, I make my own descisions and I take responsibility for my person.

If I hammer someone to death, i'm not gonna appeal to 'God made me this way', but that's essentially what you're doing... You're completely shifting any and all responsibility to God. Given, if you're coherent, you have to do the same for all the Good things we do aswell, so that's a silver lining, but it's still wrong.

Do you have children? I can't imagine, for the life of me, someone would bestow such as a set of morality on children. It's quite litereally: ""Do as thou wilt"", any shitty thing you do is God's fault and will...

How would you, morally, reprimand anyone based on this ideology? If I stab you to death, God stabbed you to death. But you are God, so God stabbed himself to death, so there's nothing going on here.

At some point you have to differentiate between your own actions and God, or it just leads to silly conclusions as illustrated above...

There are plenty of scientists who argue about where the theoretical human population tipping point is.  Some say we've already hit it, others say we have a ways to go.

Jews having been cast out for so long, ironically the dumbasses segregating them gave them the opportunity to end up with generations of people built on surviving &amp; creating wealth or a higher future

Anecdotally, as the child of Chinese immigrants to Canada, although my parents are doing pretty ok (solidly middle class in Canada), many of their friends who stayed in China and started their own businesses or whatever are now multi millionaires, and the ones who wanted to come to Canada could afford to come through investment pathways, which made it pretty easy. And this scenario seems pretty common among my other Chinese Canadian friends where their parents came to Canada earlier when China was definitely not as great a place to live, but their parents' friends stayed and did very well for themselves.

"We started eating meat long before we considering anything epistemological. Food is any organisms most basic need. No food, no life. 

Going from omnivore to vegetarian is the exception to how we’ve lived as a species for most of our existence. It’s not like we spent most of human history on a plant based diet. 

I’m not advocating we continue to rely on meat the way we currently do as a species, but you have to understand that you are asking for a massive shift from something tied to evolution and culture. 

All but one of the major religions and some sects within another say either directly or indirectly that animals are a gift from the deity(s) in question to sustain us. There might be some prohibitions on eating certain animals, but with the exception of Hinduism and some Buddhist sects we have been meat eaters for the entire common era and obviously since we started painting on cave walls somewhere between 17,000 and 20,000 years ago. 

Again not an argument against cultural shifts but this would be massive shift. If you can show that the animals we eat are basically able to think like humans, then you have a better shot at it. So far, no luck. We’re still working on getting humans on board with the idea that people who don’t look like them are not inferior.

The decline in veal sales shows that many have a conscience. As do efforts to regulate the numbers of fish species caught or the number of game tags issued. The way animals are transported and slaughtered has evolved over time. We are trending more humane. We have outlawed baiting sports involving animals, and circuses have largely dwindled in response to animal rights concerns. 

How can you call it selfish that a human parent, a species that evolved eating meat, is going to feed their children meat due its ability to meet our nutritional requirements? You admit humans are indeed animals elsewhere. If that’s the case how is it more selfish to select the more nutrient dense food for their offspring? 

Given the choice between puréed peas, canned cat food, and a mouse, is a cat cruel or selfish because it attempts to catch live prey first? Given the choice between organic cat food and mass market is the cat making a moral decision when it chooses mass market, which is likely higher in fat? When a human selects beef that costs half of the “ethical” option, is that fundamentally different than a predator picking off prey that will cost the fewest calories? 

Let’s clarify a few things about how cattle in the US are raised. 
Beef cattle range and graze and forage for the majority of their life. Grass fed cattle doesn’t typically go to feed lots, corn fed does. Cattle spend 3-12 months on a lot of they are to be grain or corn finished.

I don’t love feedlots, they’re not ideal, but they aren’t always horrific. The cattle are not terribly distressed about standing around eating. Both grass and corn/grain finished cattle are ultimately slaughtered the same way. Feedlot stays are about 3-12 months depending on the grade of beef. 

On one hand it seems that you’re arguing for the primacy of humans who are supposed to override genetics because we can at times, and on the other saying animals are just like us without showing any examples of them making the moral choice when it comes to food. 

Note that my argument is not that we shouldn’t attempt to move away from meat or find significantly better ways to produce it, (like lab grown), in an effort to find more sustainable and ethical food sources, but that the lack of an abrupt switch is not due to humanity’s pure selfishness and greed, especially when dealing with something so basic to survival.",0

He did, at least, talk the talk of the environment, and legalised gay marriage. 

I voted for May because I had a lot of issues with Corbyn and his stances on certain issues, and frankly some of his comments on the Russian invasion of Ukraine has justified that for me. I also believed she would honestly try and get a half-decent deal out of the EU, which I do actually think she tried to do that. She was absolutely not the ideal choice, given her tenure as home secretary, but she was tolerable 

Johnson was the line for me. He deliberately tanked his own government's negotiations with the EU to become Prime Minister, only to then carbon copy 90% of May's existing deal, and change 10% to make it way worse. He broke the law, he lied, he partied, his government was steeped in corruption.

"My casual (very casual) observation is that it's even more simple and stupid than what you describe.

It's more, if not almost entirely, the case that the right panders shamelessly to men, their importance, their sense of ego, their entitlement.

It doesn't matter if they're macho and have macho interests, although those interests certainly open pathways for the indoctrination, as you mentioned.

They don't have to be intelligent, the pandering is probably more effective if they aren't, just as with fascism.

The Right tells them that they've been granted the role of head-of-household by god, women should be subservient to them, but a good man will be firm &amp; authoritative in his role, yet generous and kind towards them as a benefactor (e.g., Promise Keepers).

Further, the Right is laser-focused on shaming &amp; punishing any and all men who are gender-traitors (the war on gender identity &amp; pronouns, and gay men...lesbians only get hate if they're so butch they're too close to fitting a masculine role).

The Right is also fixated on purging women from government jobs, suggesting that they're all DEI hires and more capable men were passed-over.

Conversely, there's very little pandering that men receive from the left, really quite the opposite. Women are equally capable, if not superior. Women should have equal rights and equal pay. Men are pigs, men have dominated the political landscape for too long, men are too entrenched in various career fields, etc..

I'm going to avoid race, simply because this gender divide transcends race to a large extent.

I've met an engineer that has lead teams to design ICBMs from the ground up, worked on testing submarines and built race cars in his spare time. Only to find out he has the most extreme fixation of OCD a person can have over the smallest things (nothing can be out of place).

I've met authors that traversed and plotted out the entire cave systems throughout a state, in the craziest working conditions, all for published the findings for research, only to find out they have a crazy obsession with dogs (still kind people), were talking 14+ dogs.

Want to know something funny? All of these people vote republican.

**TLDR:** Even the most educated and accomplished individuals can hold irrational beliefs or exhibit extreme personal quirks. Credentials don't guarantee critical thinking or intellectual consistency, meaning that anti-intellectualism isn't just a product of ignorance, but can coexist with expertise. An administration change isn't going to change operating opinions at a fundamental level.

&gt;*""(And just look at any Chinese city; even a Tier 3 Chinese city looks way more futuristic than any American city. That says something about the two countries' different attitudes towards progress.)""*

Overall, this seems to be more of a ""China vs US"" post at its core, so I'll address point.

""Looks at us, our buildings our brighter than yours in the US, our technology is better than US, our subways are better than US, our train systems are faster than in the US, our bridges are the largest compared to the US, our surgeries can be done remotely just like the US"".

Its projection of China's own insecurities. Once you see the patterns, its obvious its a government driven inferiority complex. Everything you see China related is curated, we don't share the same internet space. Over time you're just inheriting these are as your opinions based on what you see on Tiktok (its always tiktok). The more you look into it, the US and EU have had the technologies for a long time. Pick a topic and dig into it, you'll find the same. If you want to visit China, go for it, no ones stopping you.

95% of the people in the U.S. don't care about what's happening in China unless you own a business that operates there or have family. Its simple, don't annex countries, don't spy on us or try to steal hard work, don't violate human rights. That's literally it.",0

States are in charge of their energy and few to none are liberal states. 



&gt; If the reactors are government owned and funded then they don’t need to recoup the costs.

That's kind of the problem. If the plants are built by the tax payer, the ongoing generation is funded by the tax payer and the staff paid by the tax payer - the tax payer should want the energy to be cost competitive. Because guess who's buying that power in the end. It's the tax payer. 

I've not seen a single report anywhere in the world that shows that nuclear is cheaper per mWh and that's an issue. People act like baseload is everything but as the sources going into the grid become more varied, baseload actually becomes the problem - especially if you have too much. 

If battery tech and storage is 90% cheaper now per kwh than it was 10 years ago, imagine 15 years from now? Same with renewable costs and generation - those costs are going down and quickly.

Renewables cannnot provide hope of stopping climate change, because [renewables can only add energy, not make us stop using fossil fuels](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2025/01/02/Reality-Check-Energy-Transition/).  If anything, renewables might enable more lower EROI fossil fuel burnning. 

There are however reasons to be hopeful:  

First, renewables provide a reasons specific societies could better survive a serious decline in fossil fuel availability.  This impacts how people, including leaders, view accessing those fossil fuels.

Second, we almost never afaik targeted refineries during conflicts even a decade ago, but now conflicts in Ukraine and Iran started hitting refineries more.  If this escalates, then we could eventually destroy much of our refining capacity, so that's finally a plausible pathway to leaving the fossil fuels in the ground.

Third, the first and seocnd interact, because if people envision renewables powering some essentials, then they'll have more willingness to desttory their adversaries fossil fuel access, even when doing so slightly reduces their own access.

Finally, climate change seemingly only ranks 4th scarriest among the [planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html).  The sooner &amp; worse we suffer agricultural collapse, the sooner we slow transgressing other planetary boundaries, and ultimately the more humans survive.

"&gt;if you made a carbon tax ... But it never gets passed

I don't understand. The EU ETS is effectively a carbon tax. It covers 45% of the EU emissions, and there are plans to cover a larger proportion. On top of that, many EU countries tax gas fuel due to their negative externalities (both carbon and air pollution). We do tax carbon.

A large part of the emissions not covered by the EU ETS are emissions linked to agriculture. And it's probably because politicians anticipate a backlash, since it's one area where the rich don't emit that much more than the poor (probably less, as a proportion of income). It's not like rich consumers are the blocking point on this one.

To come back to air travel: intra-EU flights and flights to Switzerland/UK are already included. There were plans to include other plans, but they were put on pause to focus on the global measure (CORSIA) developped by the Civil Aviation Organization ([source](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/transport/reducing-emissions-aviation_en)).

"Kids are not the property of the parent, they are the responsibility of the child. You can't discard of your child when you want, or neglect it like you can an old pair of sneakers. The law requires parents to take care of their children.

If it's winter and the kid isn't wearing appropriate clothes the parents are held responsible. If the child is malnourished, the parents are responsible. If the child steals or damages someone else's property, the parent is held responsible.

The burden of taking care of children is placed on their parents, or guardians.The state doesn't have to pay the full bill for raising the child, and they aren't the ones dedicating their time to provide care round the clock.  That is the job of the parent. With this burden comes a bit of freedom to decide what is the proper way to take care of their children.

In regards to home schooling. Most kids who are home schooled receive a far greater education than those in public school. Most states in the US do have some type of standards that the kid needs to meet everyone so often.

In regards to healthcare if it is found out a child is neglected medically, the parent often can and will be charged with a crime.

If the religious services include something illegal, the freedom of religion doesn't cover that. A child is more likely to be the victim of violence or sexual violence attending public school or in municipal sports/services than attending religious school/services/events. 

So the alternatives of public schooling and services is more often worse for the education and physical well being of the child, than homeschooling or religious services.",0
"Agreed, it’s not hard to glance at the “miles to empty” indicator every now and then. Again, it’s exactly the same on both gas and EVs. Sucks that you have to wait for someone to bring you a portable fuel container though. With an EV almost anyone can give you a quick charge. 

Every tow truck also carries a battery for giving quick charge these days. Just like they’ll give you a gallon of gas to get off the road and to a service station. It’s no different.

"Alberta has good wind potential, but none of it is offshore, and the Alberta oil industry has zero experience with anything offshore.  


Drilling technology does translate well to geothermal, and geothermal could be a good seasonal complement to solar.  The depths required to access decent grade heat (5 -7 km) could be a stretch though.


Converting the natural gas grid, including storage facilities, to hydrogen might be possible which would allow hydrogen to be used as a seasonal energy storage medium, but it will never be an export commodity.  Round trip energy efficiency is poor, and there are places with both ocean access and significantly better solar resources.  Ammonia makes transportation easier, but cuts energy efficiency in half again.


Converting the gas grid to hydrogen would also require CCUS, because there is a lot of residual methane in the depleted natural gas reservoirs used for storage that would all be produced eventually, even if the hydrogen being pumped in was green.",1

"Unironically? Regulation. That's how you fix it. That is *explicitly* the tool that nations use to resolve issues like this. 

All that annoying red tape, all those little rules you need to follow, all those stupid inspectors checking things; they all serve pretty important purposes. Often they were gained because people were exploited so cruelly that they revolted, as you said. And now a lot of them have been, or are being, torn down by people so old they no longer live in reality, just some warped delusional fantasy where life is simple and everyone is doing fine and is just entitled and whiny.

The other problem is.... It's *not* given as encouragement. Usually it's used to *dismiss* issues that people are having. So if someone can't find a job, they'll just say ""well keep sending out resumes you'll get one eventually"" and then when you tell them you've sent out thousands without a response and that corporations are actively putting up fake want ads just to lie about hiring on more people while internally promoting instead, they'll just use some thought terminating cliche, forget that you said that, and tell you to send more resumes out tomorrow.

"We have to change central grid planning for cities to decarbonize so that the people don’t use fossil fuels to stay warm or drive.   But right now we are choosing to invest in the stability of the profits of oil and gas.  We don’t have ready made solutions for global warming, because we have the most rich and powerful companies and governments in the world fighting against change by actively downplaying the threats of climate change.  

For instance liquid natural gas heats the atmosphere 80 times more than oil and gas, but the calculations on paper say it’s better than coal.  So we spend billions of dollars converting to liquid natural gas while the calculations that say liquid natural gas is better than coal are based off natural gas likes not leaking. 

So we are actively lied to- to push the development of lng facilities while greenwashing the cost to the environment.

Autonomy over children, is about a parent’s freedom to make choices for their kids based on their own values and judgment. It’s the scope of their decision-making powe or how much room they have to call the shots without someone else stepping in **LIKE THE PRETEXT OF THIS THREAD** It is the ""space"" parents operate in, It emphasizes independence and self-direction, with the focus on the **parent’s right to choose.**

""Authority"" over children, on the other hand, is more about the power or control parents have to enforce those choices. It’s not just about having the freedom to decide, it’s about the ability to make those decisions stick. Authority is the muscle behind the role: a parent telling their kid, “You’re going to bed now,” It’s less about the range of options and more about the command within that range.

Autonomy is the ""what"" (what a parent can decide), while authority is the ""how"" (how they make it happen). A parent might have autonomy to choose a vegan diet for their kid, but if the kid flat-out refuses to eat it, their authority gets tested. In some cases, a parent could have autonomy without much authority like if laws back their right to decide but they can’t enforce it at home. 

Conversely, they might have authority in the household but limited autonomy if laws or schools override their preferences.

The two overlap a lot in parenting, but autonomy leans toward **freedom from external meddling**, while authority leans toward control over the child.

We know all matter is energy and there is fixed amount of energy. So matter is literally just energy and information. We also know color and sounds are a construct of our mind not a real physical phenomenon. So most of senses are lies told to us by our brain. We also know in quantum mechanics things respond to simply being observed, this suggests everything is connected somehow. There are even hypotheses that objects simply don’t exist if they aren’t being observed by a conscious entity or at least behave differently. And quantum entanglement show that we can effect things instantly at a distance. There are also some experiments that suggest actions in the present can retroactively affect the past. If we accept this as truth then the only explanation I can think of is that time and space are not real and it’s just our consciousness making things up.

"I don’t think “distraction” is a fair characterization because those other things are also of major consequence.  I think the strategy of “flooding the zone” does make it difficult to focus on fighting one particular thing, but to say something is a “distraction” implies that it’s a feint, something not substantial intended to hide what is important.  

For example if I burn down your house and your small business at the same time, it creates a “Sophie’s choice” of which one you need to save, but they’re both going to cause serious damage to your life. 

We might say, the intention was to destroy the business, the house was just a tool so it’s a distraction, but I think in the case of DOGE, Tariffs, and the tax cuts they are mutually reinforcing and all parts of the same plan.  
Cutting spending makes passing the tax cuts easier and raising tariffs provides a new form of taxation to fill the gaps from cutting taxes. It’s a much more regressive tax so the burden is shifted from the rich to the middle/working class. Budget cuts have the same effect, reducing transfers from wealthy and corporations to the rest of us in the form of social services, public education, etc.  So all three ultimately synergize to achieve the same end.",0

A team of astronomers has found that Venus has never been habitable, despite decades of speculation that our closest planetary neighbor was once much more like Earth than it is today, says Phys.org.

&gt;The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, studied the chemical composition of the Venusian atmosphere and inferred that its interior is too dry today for there ever to have been enough water for oceans to exist at its surface.

"The article is well written. In short, it explains the importance of calibration and accuracy in temperature measurements, and how people love to use many digits, without understanding measurement errors. 

Looking back at my own training, I value being taught how to measure accurately, without making ridiculous claims about accuracy and I learned to be comfortable with poor accuracy. 

In my career, I have worked with many talented students from top universities, who could not handle imperfections. They would rather not report results than have to admit they could not measure something as accurately as they wanted. 

Another often occurring issue is substituting measurement accuracy with statistics, taking a bunch of measurements (easy today with digital data acquisition, not so easy when we learned the trade on analogue equipment) and averaging them to obtain tiny standard deviations to claim high accuracy. These numbers are meaningless without knowing how accurate each individual measurement is.

To make a long story short: there are not many people who understand how to measure accurately. Most scientists and engineers prefer to sit behind a computer anyway, being comfortable with simulations that don’t give unexpected results. Only few dare to experiment and face the craziness offered by Mother Nature and of those mad scientists again only a few know how to properly measure.

I’m afraid the climate change community has very few scientists with a solid measurement background who have the balls to question dogma.

"After doing a postdoc in Geneva, and associating with all these Green Europeans, we decided to give up our car. That was 35 years ago, and we are still going strong. We have lived in walkable areas and decidedly non-walkable areas. This is how we did it: 

We made a list of places we had to be within walking distance of-- for us that included a grocery store, a library, and university, and transit hub, a swimming pool and gym, nature. We never got everything we wanted. Some places we needed to be within a bus ride away-- hospital et al. We looked at maps and neighborhoods before moving-- this was before the Internet, so everything was paper maps. Some places we lived had horrible public transportation, some places were dangerous to cycle or walk, but we figured out the logistics when we moved there. 

We do rent a car a couple times a year for bulky and heavy items, and we also enjoy that time to go out into nature and hike and camp, and visit distant relatives.

We also put aside the money we would have spent on a car, minus what we spend on public transport and car rentals. You would be gobsmacked at how much that saves.

Like how can you blame prosperity gospel on Christianity's existence? How does anyone read the gospels and come to the conclusion that Jesus will reward his most faithful people with material wealth?

People created prosperity gospel because they wanted to be rich and feel like that wealth meant they were better than everyone else.

"Your first question, no often times there are grants or stipulations to how public money can be spent. These stipulations add a bunch of expensive red tape. For example, maybe the state offers money to cities to build public housing. The state requires that they need to implement green energy stuff. Now the cost to build that housing went up a ton. Instead of tackling housing and green energy separately, they tried to do both and now have done neither. That’s a dumb example off the top of my head, you really need to get into the nitty gritty of each example to realize how dumb it all is. 

2) yes if you have the political will to do so. But that political will isn’t there. Once you open up money to spent, everyone wants their needs to be accounted for and money to be spent on them. Everyone puts their hand out. And usually the only way you even get the political will to be able to spend public money in the first place is by putting money in those hands. 

3) no again this sounds great in theory but does not work out in the US. Here everyone has a say. The state is not powerful enough to effectively centrally plan. Basically anything they do is mired in lawsuits. Too many competing interests. Central planning = someone is pissed off. Which means loss of money or votes in elections. Which means central planners don’t want to effectively centrally plan. 

I agree that in instances where the free market cannot adequately solve the problem, the state needs to step in. And I wouldn’t mind the state doing it in the U.S. but they need to massively overhaul the system to take away the handicaps they place on themselves. There’s way too many laws that let way too many bad actors get involved to prevent things or get their way. Environmental reviews, labor laws, etc. You don’t support all this “deregulation” until you actually see what the regulation is and looks like, what it allows bad actors (who couldnt give 2 shits about the environment) to do.

"Interesting you open your argument this way. I am currently in camp 3 (work for mega corp, paid comparatively well) but frequently dream of running off to camp 1 (live in the woods).

&gt;The billionaire only exists when enough people are willing to choose their enterprise to work. The employee must get value or they will choose another alternative

This argument again presumes the employees have a choice in their enterprise, and in return get ""value."" The choice presented to us is: pay to live. Pay for the roof. For the Transport. For the education. For your family. For your healthcare. This is not a choice, it is an implicit threat. If you fail to produce enough money to sustain a decent existence, it is chocked up to individual failure and lack of tenacity or value. It implies meritocracy and a certain fairness to this system when instead it often comes down to a game of chance. A game of place and time. Malcom Gladwell's Outliers deals with this question.

""The billionaire exists"" completely outside of this system. More specifically, the centi-billionaire almost unanimously exists outside of this system. So those individuals that own over $100B almost never came to it without significant hand outs, either by birthright, or by significant charitable contribution from some pre-existing aristocratic network of wealth. To maintain that wealth, they must colonize natural resources and extract the value of their workers to create that ""creation at scale."" All of this to enrich themselves to have more financial influence than most small nations. With no upper limit on how much they should acquire or how it should be leveraged. These are the personality traits of a sociopath.

These systems contradict each other and those with the most capital spin a very convincing tale of meritocracy to cover the tracks of exploitation.",1

"In my point of view as a Chinese, it's a pretty decent deal. 

What I know for VW is they've invest a lot in EV researching but the efficiency is very low. I don't know if you heard about catfish effect before but the fact is by introducing a highly competence brand into the market, local brands would be forced to be more efficient and innovative to embrace the competition. This is exactly the case when Tesla's Shanghai factory getting approved in 2018. All Chinese regard this as the starting point of the new era because brands have no motivation to provide better product without this kind of competition. 

Nobody are born to be the leader in an industry, but you have to compete to become better. It's true that tariffs can protect market temporarily just as painkiller. However, when technology gap become larger and larger, there will be a generational gap in products sooner or later and the trade barrier would be crashed then. It's my prediction for US market btw. Europe has better foundations than America. BYD is leading by 100 meters in a marathon, why not trying to catchup? Disqualify Chinese brands is just self-deception.

With some limitation, the competition is fair enough. Minimum prices is better than tariffs because this can transform the limitation into ""tuition fee"", making your opponent more motivated.

Competition is indispensable to human development. That's how we get there all along the way, and how we create a better world in the future. We will all benefit from this in you see all of this in a longer run.",1

"You're missing the point. The blockchain and its immutable ledger are often seen as a breakthrough, but they are ultimately irrelevant when it comes to the value of cryptocurrencies. Here's why.

Imagine you have a vault designed to protect something infinitely replicable, like air. The blockchain is like a high-security system for this vault, ensuring that the air inside is tracked, recorded, and securely stored. But here's the catch: air is everywhere, it's free, and it's abundant. There’s no need to protect or track something that can be obtained with no effort, no cost, and in limitless quantities.

The absurdity of this analogy mirrors the situation with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain may secure the transactions and record every Bitcoin transfer, but what’s being secured? Digital tokens that are infinitely replicable and not tied to anything of real value. Just like locking up air in a vault doesn't make it scarce or valuable, securing an infinitely replicable token with blockchain technology doesn't add value to the token itself.

The whole system is absurd because it's protecting and recording something that anyone can create at will. If you can easily replicate the ""product"" (air or digital tokens) with a click of a button, no amount of security or transparency changes the fact that it is worth nothing. It’s like installing a sophisticated security system to protect air. It’s a technological achievement, but it doesn’t make the air valuable. Similarly, blockchain doesn’t make cryptocurrencies valuable; it just secures and tracks something that’s easily replicable and ultimately worthless. Proving that absurdity of the whole thing.",1
"&gt;A nuclear war between India and Pakistan — which share a long history of conflicts — would not only result in 50 to 125 million direct fatalities but could jeopardize the entire planet, causing sharp drops in global temperatures and precipitation that could devastate the world's food supply, according to a new study published October 2 in Science Advances.

&gt;The authors evaluated a simulated nuclear war scenario for the year 2025 between the two countries based on advice from policy and military experts. They find that if Pakistan attacks urban targets in 2025 with 150 nuclear weapons and if India responds with 100 nuclear weapons, depending on the size of the weapons, ranging from 15-kiloton to 100-kiloton, smoke from burning cities would release 16 to 36 teragrams of black carbon into the atmosphere, blocking out sunlight and cooling the global surface by 2 to 5°C (3.6 to 9°F).

"nevermind, I found another source that dives more into the chemistry aspect of it, if you're well versed in chemistry I think you'll be able to appreciate how they managed to engineer this plastic and how it degrades when it interact with ions in seawater(every paragraph after this is from another source https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1065343):

In their new study, Aida and his team focused on solving this problem with supramolecular plastics—polymers with structures held together by reversible interactions. The new plastics were made by combining two ionic monomers that form cross-linked salt bridges, which provide strength and flexibility. In the initial tests, one of the monomers was a common food additive called sodium hexametaphosphate and the other was any of several guanidinium ion-based monomers. Both monomers can be metabolized by bacteria, ensuring biodegradability once the plastic is dissolved into its components.

“While the reversable nature of the bonds in supramolecular plastics have been thought to make them weak and unstable,” says Aida, “our new materials are just the opposite.” In the new material, the salt bridges structure is irreversible unless exposed to electrolytes like those found in seawater. The key discovery was how to create these selectively irreversible cross links.

As with oil with water, after mixing the two monomers together in water, the researchers observed two separated liquids. One was thick and viscous and contained the important structural cross linked salt bridges, while the other was watery and contained salt ions. For example, when sodium hexametaphosphate and alkyl diguanidinium sulfate were used, sodium sulphate salt was expelled into the watery layer. The final plastic, alkyl SP₂, was made by drying what remained in the thick viscous liquid layer.

The “desalting” turned out to be the critical step; without it, the resulting dried material was a brittle crystal, unfit for use. Resalting the plastic by placing it in salt water caused the interactions to reverse and the plastic’s structure destabilized in a matter of hours. Thus, having created a strong and durable plastic that can still be dissolved under certain conditions, the researchers next tested the plastic’s quality.",1

"Small particulate matter (PM2.5) in air pollution raises the risks of respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even cognitive decline. Heat waves, which are occurring more often with climate change, can cause heatstroke and exacerbate conditions such as asthma and diabetes. When heat and pollution coincide, they can create a deadly combination.

  
Existing studies on hot and polluted episodes (HPEs) have often focused on local, urban settings, so their findings are not necessarily representative of HPEs around the world. To better understand premature mortality associated with pollution exposure during HPEs at multiple scales and settings, Huang et al. looked at a global record of climate and PM2.5 levels from 1990 to 2019.

The team used data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), which included hourly concentration measurements of PM2.5 in the form of dust, sea salt, black carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate particles. Daily maximum temperatures were obtained via satellite data from ERA5 (the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis).

The researchers also conducted a meta-analysis of health literature, identifying relevant research using the search terms “PM2.5,” “high temperature,” “heatwaves,” and “all-cause mortality” in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Then, they conducted a statistical analysis to estimate PM2.5-associated premature mortality events during HPEs.

They found that both the frequency of HPEs and maximum PM2.5 levels during HPEs have increased significantly over the past 30 years. The team estimated that exposure to PM2.5 during HPEs caused 694,440 premature deaths globally between 1990 and 2019, 80% of which occurred in the Global South. With an estimated 142,765 deaths, India had the highest mortality burden by far, surpassing the combined total of China and Nigeria, which had the second- and third-highest burdens. The United States was the most vulnerable of the Global North countries, with an estimated 32,227 deaths.

"&gt;A new report from the American Lung Association notes a drastic decline in air quality and raises health alarms. Climate change and Trump administration actions, experts warn, will worsen the trend.   
                
&gt;More Americans are being forced to breathe unhealthy air than at any other time in the past decade, according to a report released Wednesday by the American Lung Association.   
     
&gt;Nearly half of Americans—or about 156 million people—are living in counties with failing grades for ozone or particulate matter pollution, two of the most common and dangerous air pollutants. That’s 25 million more people than in the 2024 report.   
         
&gt;“This is drastically worse than the findings in last year’s [report] and a shocking demonstration of a trend that not only is continuing but worsening as a consequence of climate change,” reads the report, which is the 26th installment in an [annual series](https://www.lung.org/research/sota) called “State of the Air.”   
          
&gt;Air pollution is a serious health risk that can cause and exacerbate asthma and cardiovascular diseases, reduce lung function, trigger low birth weights and even lead to early death. Research has linked air pollution to worsening dementia and cancer, and the World Health Organization [estimates](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/air-pollution--the-invisible-health-threat) that air pollution is responsible for 7 million premature deaths per year—the equivalent of one death every 13 minutes.  
    
&gt;In other words, Wednesday’s report is bad news for public health.    
         
&gt;For much of the past half-century, the federal government has enacted regulations to reduce air pollution. Now, the Trump administration is rapidly dismantling efforts to track and limit hazardous pollutants, eliminating crucial data and research on air pollution and health disparities and reversing efforts to control sources of pollution that are fueling climate change and hazardous air, to the [dismay](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19032025/epa-deregulation-public-health-risk/) of the nation’s doctors and public health experts.  
         
&gt;While the State of the Air projects dire circumstances for millions of Americans, it only highlights pollution in U.S. counties with active air quality monitoring sites. A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425310122) from Pennsylvania State University researchers, published on Monday, found that 58 percent of U.S. counties have no active air quality monitoring by the EPA. That’s 50 million people who aren’t included in the ALA’s report and don’t know what kind of air they’re breathing—meaning the state of the nation’s situation could be even worse than is known. [1]

&gt;This year all three mining giants said the same thing within the same month: mines will be electric. They’d assessed all of the alternatives including biodiesel and especially hydrogen, and found that using electricity as directly as possible was so much cheaper and more effective that it was no longer worth considering alternatives. The biggest trucks will have big batteries, and will often be tied to catenary overhead lines.

&gt;Whether underground or above ground, the advantages of electric vehicles are significant. Regenerative braking as the vehicles rolled down hills will recharge the batteries or flow back into the mine’s local grid. Electric mining vehicles have no emissions underground, significantly reducing the high expense of mining ventilation. The torque and speed requirements are deeply into electric motors’ sweet spot.

"Attempting to produce as much energy with nuclear as converting 10% of pasture to agrivoltaics would produce would exhaust all known and assumed to exist uranium in 6 months.

No reactor has ever come close to breeding its own fuel from thorium, and the fuel reprocessing process is a complete economic non-starter that will turn every nuclear plant into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar cleanup project like hanford or sellafield

If you somehow found a magic uranium source that could do it anyway or told the people that want safe drinking water to drink Pa233, then the thermal forcing from the exhaust heat would be larger than the current thermal forcing from CO2.

The xenon-135 emissions would be so great it would have its own climate change effects due to atmosphere ionisation as significant as NOx or SO2. The cancer spike from this would also be measurable.

"The methanol route has some challenges in scourcing  clean co2 or similar carbon source.

Options like co2 feed are expensive to capture and still have an associated emission at the other end of the product chain (unless plastics or similar locked away product). 
Biomass feed options, the getting enough and delivering enough biomass is hard in volume, it competes with food stocks for land and agriculture. 
Waste (municipal or other) options are limited in feedstock.  
There is a unicorn option around corn ethanol production and co2 capture but the location start to mean it’s a local product.  Outside of this it’s hard sourcing input streams.

All these options are hard, then add in a turning 1/3rd of your expensive hydrogen into water, the high temp process, the fact you still have a co2 emission if burn methanol at end of value chain, and it makes it challenging and expensive.

Add these issues together and I struggle for it to be more than a niche product to perhaps generate specialist green plastics in relatively small volumes.
Even just trying to find enough feedstock for an industrial scale plant is a really struggle.

Also when talking about SpaceX, it made me curious. The last 6 months or so, I’ve started to question a little birdie named Elon Musk. At first I enjoyed and liked him. Funny. Extremely intelligent and entertaining. Doesn’t give a fuck. But lately, I’m like what his angle. What’s he trying to wheel and deal. He’s really an egotistical sociopath. Go through his business dealing of M&amp;A and choosing of board members of companies in the past. It’s quite astonishing. Nepotism at the top. And the fact you said SpaceX is only operating is because government contracts. Okay, so you’re going to have to bear with me again. Just try and play devils advocate. Something is going on with him and the autonomy of power he has. It goes to show. Money = power. Don’t matter if you a world leader. I think it’s FOR SURE a fact that Elon believes in a technocracy. He very well could be calling the shots and i don’t think it’s all because of his money and donations. What if he is pressuring and blackmailing governments that say if he doesn’t get what he wants, he will blow the whistle on space. I know it’s out there. He very well could have such political influence due to his skill and knowledge that he is needed and he gets what he wants because of it. But, I could very well see him knowing all along the truth about space and started SpaceX back in 2001 or 2002 because he knew eventually space flight would become private and he could hold on the cards. I mean SpaceX has only flown humans to the ISS. Nothing further. I know that’s not SpaceX’s mission. It’s reusability and colonization of Mars, but it is odd that in 1969 a craft that was the same as an aluminum Coca Cola can (seriously look it up. It was equivalent to a can. the spacecraft that sent humans to the Moon was done in a mother fucking Coca Cola can) was able to safely and successfully go to the moon and back. Yet, SpaceX can’t. Elon said they don’t have the resources to be able to do that. How does humanity regress that quickly in technology? The only other time in human history this happened was I guess the great pyramids and the fall of the Western Roman Empire that sent humanity back hundreds of years to the Dark Ages. But in a span of 50 with no societal, social, or economic collapse were  able to lose that ability. 

SIDENOTE: it’s crazy to me that for thousands and thousands and thousands of years humanity was primitive beings. We were still riding fucking horses in the late 1800s, but at the turn of the century it all changed. Almost like we took steroids for our brain and innovation ability. Look at this transition: we went from horses to cars to airplanes to nuclear bombs to fucking flying into space to the internet to smart phones and now to AI. like that is crazy to me. 99.97% of human history was primitive and this .03% is where everything changed. 

I think that’s evident of bad signs. We have progressed so much so fast that it will be the destruction of us. Unfortunately, I just don’t see humanity living longer than another century (maybe two if we are lucky)

But back to Elon, ya low key could see him being very very very sneaky. You heard it here first, Elon Musk is running and calling all the shots for the NWO and DS. Wouldn’t surprise me one bit.

"Coral and mollusks don't care about the rate of increase of bicarbonate, they have no biological mechanisms with which to even measure or track that. No, coral and mollusks respond very strongly to bicarbonate concentration itself... the higher it is, the faster they undergo calcification.

And bicarbonate necessarily scales with atmospheric CO2 concentration:

**\[1\]** CO2 (carbon dioxide) + H2O (water) ==&gt; H2CO3 (carbonic acid)

**\[2\]** Aqueous: H2CO3 (carbonic acid, from **\[1\]**) ==&gt; H^(+) (hydrogen cation) + HCO3^(-) (bicarbonate anion)

That is arguably why we had the Cambrian Explosion... CO2 concentration was very high (peaking at \~7100 ppm), so bicarbonate concentration was high, so calcification was very easy, so a wide plethora of taxa developed.

As CO2 concentration subsequently fell, the less-efficient, less-fit organisms found it too difficult to continue, and so became extinct.

IOW, CO2, that molecule of life, expands life. It doesn't kill life until you get up around \~45,000 ppm (the concentration where people start having trouble flushing it from their bloodstream), and even if we were to burn every cord of wood, every drop of oil, every cubic foot of natural gas, every chunk of coal... we'd never even get close to 45,000 ppm. It's likely we wouldn't even reach the \~7100 ppm peak of the Cambrian.

Assuming 5 is average, both people in that relationship would be above average, but I think many women who are 6s view men who are 6s as beneath them. 

I think part of the issue is that many women believe that men are more interested in the aspects they find attractive (and their corresponding value on that 1-10 scale) than they actually are. 

For example, a woman with a J.D. and a high power, high paying career as a corporate lawyer may believe this would help make her extremely desirable as a partner, in the same way that a man with those credentials would be desirable to her. On the contrary, to many men, those credentials are likely to be neutral *at best*.  

Many men are looking for a woman who will be the mother of their children. A man will see that woman as intelligent, hard working, and driven. While these traits are largely positive, if she is unwilling to have children, he may find that unattractive. If she is willing to have children, but unwilling to reduce her hours (which for lawyers can add up to 80+ a week), he may be forced to be the primary caretaker of the children, potentially giving up his own career (another possible dealbreaker). 

The point is that the woman in this example would likely see herself as a high value woman. She’s not wrong, but when it comes to potential partners, she may be looking only for equally or higher value men. This is could be extremely problematic because if she makes $400k and a man makes $500k, she may find him attractive as a partner, but he might not for a variety of reasons. 

The reality may be that, for that woman, she is likely looking in the wrong place for a man.  She would scoff at the idea of dating a school teacher making $50k a year, but he might be the best partner for her.",1

Orbital maneuvering around Lagrange points is weird, maneuvering solar sails is weird, and thirdly this solar shade is basically in a lofted trajectory, constantly thrusting upward to be in an orbit slower than orbital speed. Our solar shade is a solar sail which will be constantly thrusting upward as it reflects sun away from the Earth. 

This means it's going to be slightly closer to the sun, and that's when it's turned on. We're going to want to be able to turn these edge on to let the sun through, so they'll have to deal with then falling back to the actual L1 point while holding position between the earth and sun, so they can flip back to block light at any moment.

&gt;If the US and UK didn't want to set a precedent of states seceding, why would they help broker a peace settlement that accomplished exactly that?

Because the Sudanese conflict was of an enormously different scale. More people died and were displaced in South Sudan in the 90's than live in Somaliland in the present.

The African Union allowed for the independence of South Sudan. South Sudan is th exception to African secessionist movements because of the scale.

Beyond that Europe and Asia have seen more border changes than Africa since the transition away from colonial rule in 1960. Africa has remained remarkably stable - in terms of states.

[https://substack.com/@hannahritchie/p-148713898](https://substack.com/@hannahritchie/p-148713898)

&gt;Too often, lifestyle change is seen as somehow separate from system change, and not as important. But we need both, and they are deeply connected.

&gt;Lifestyle change and system change are two sides of the same coin.

[https://climateoutreach.org/lifestyle-change-system-change-two-sides-same-coin/](https://climateoutreach.org/lifestyle-change-system-change-two-sides-same-coin/)

The more obvious example is the vehicles we choose to drive.  In 2023, Americans buying new vehicles bought 10% EV, 90% ICE:

[https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/nearly-one-in-five-cars-sold-in-2023-was-electric](https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/nearly-one-in-five-cars-sold-in-2023-was-electric)

The next year?  Same thing, 10% EV and 90% ICE:

[https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales](https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales)

The average American drives a new car for 8 years, so people who bought a new ICE vehicle in the last two years are hoping that oil is cheap and plentiful until at least the 2030s.  And this is a case where individual choices add up to having a significant impact, especially when you consider that our choices are still large vehicles like SUVs and trucks.

&gt;SUVs weigh 200-300 kg more than an average medium-sized car, and typically take up nearly 0.3 m2 more space – emitting roughly 20% more carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The trend towards heavier and less fuel-efficient cars increases energy demand, including oil and electricity use, as well as demand for basic metals and critical minerals needed for battery production. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, global oil consumption directly related to SUVs rose by a total of over 600 000 barrels per day, accounting for more than a quarter of the overall annual growth in oil demand. 

[https://www.iea.org/commentaries/suvs-are-setting-new-sales-records-each-year-and-so-are-their-emissions](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/suvs-are-setting-new-sales-records-each-year-and-so-are-their-emissions)

The structural component of climate change, the portion that extracts oil, refines it, and brings it to the gas station, will never change as long as people keep making this kind of choice.  We're sending a clear signal that we want an oil-based lifestyle, despite claims that we want climate change to be addressed.",1

"From the article:

Since 2018, carbon emissions from data centers in the US have tripled. For the 12 months ending August 2024, data centers were responsible for 105 million metric tons of CO2, accounting for 2.18% of national emissions (for comparison, domestic commercial airlines are responsible for about 131 million metric tons). About 4.59% of all the energy used in the US goes toward data centers, a figure that’s doubled since 2018.

It’s difficult to put a number on how much AI in particular, which has been booming since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, is responsible for this surge. That’s because data centers process lots of different types of data—in addition to training or pinging AI models, they do everything from hosting websites to storing your photos in the cloud. However, the researchers say, AI’s share is certainly growing rapidly as nearly every segment of the economy attempts to adopt the technology.

“It’s a pretty big surge,” says Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at the think tank Energy Innovation. “There’s a lot of breathless analysis about how quickly this exponential growth could go. But it’s still early days for the business in terms of figuring out efficiencies, or different kinds of chips.”",1
"Unlike North Korea, the Ayatollahs do not mind their own business. North Korea is dangerous but does not go around attacking other countries. The Ayatollahs, on the other hand, constantly provoke regional instability by supporting groups that target US interests and partners across the Middle East. That makes the idea of a nuclear armed Iran far more dangerous.



The issue is not the West trying to deny Iran nuclear weapons out of bias or double standards. The real problem lies in the nature of the Ayatollah regime itself. Iran is run by an unelected theocracy that combines religious authority with absolute political power. The supreme leader answers to no one and dissent is crushed. That is fundamentally different from dealing with a flawed democracy or even a traditional authoritarian state.



This is not about us versus them. It is about the fact that the Ayatollahs have repeatedly acted in ways that threaten regional security, global energy markets and basic human rights. If the Ayatollahs respected their own people and did not treat diplomacy as a stalling tactic, the nuclear issue might look very different. But under this regime, the risk is not just theoretical. It is active, ongoing and driven by ideology rather than national interest.",0

"It is hard to square what is happening in Toronto with this idea. 

I did the new build move. Managed to negotiate the rent raises down a little, but between moving and new build rent climbs, my rent effectively doubled over the course of a couple of years. I was paying almost twice as much for about the same amount of space, if not less. 

And construction is going BADLY in Toronto. People bought pre-construction condos, and they’re years behind on construction, if they’re being finished at all. Plenty of people just aren’t getting the condo they paid for. 

Toronto has a supply problem, of course. We can only build up or we hit the green belt and basically screw ourselves because Toronto already floods alarmingly fast, I don’t want to know what’ll happen if we go ham on the wetlands. 

But, Toronto did have vacancy rates climb during covid, and there was the tiniest dip in rent. Often from new builds that aren’t rent controlled. 

Also, the new builds are often horribly constructed. I love a new, pristine Toronto condo with flooring that scratches if you look at it too hard. (That’s also not really a construction issue, but there have been other problems as well.) 

It’s hard to be certain scrapping rent control is the cause of these problems — we were on this path before Dougie, or at least on a path that was heading in the same general direction. 

Also, Ford is basically a proud believer in cronyism and his corruption is comically obvious. It can’t help that we have a premier who hates Toronto. 

But it really doesn’t seem like killing rent control helped us all that much. I mean, it hurt me specifically, and most people I know, and also a lot of people I know left the city, but that’s anecdotal, not data. The data processed for broader public consumption tends to contradict itself and the insights it offers range from “it sucks out there” to “it might not suck as much as people think (but it still sucks)”. 

And we do know that people are losing housing, and that the unhoused population grew rapidly during covid. But even covid, and supply line troubles in general, offer complicating factors.

I’m willing to believe that rent control doesn’t work, but it’s hard to square with lived experience. Which is the problem, I guess. It’s hard to be cool with losing housing because eventually number will go up.

By comparison:

Someone at the top 10% by wealth might have a net worth of about $137,000 USD or more

"There is a really healthy subset of left policy issues that do poll extremely well, and they are by no accident the policies that have shifted to the corners of political discourse. That's why I try to make a distinction between left/right political culture/platforms and left/right culture war.   
  
It's hard for me to walk the line here between criticizing the left and advocating for the cultural shift towards the right (which I do not), and a lot of this is based on perception instead of reality. I think it's important to try to understand what people are thinking and why things are happening though, because the longstanding technique of shaming and denouncing anyone on the wrong side of issues as being evil has really lost effectiveness and I believe actually become a driving force for the cultural shift.  
  
The left has been the ruling class of the culture war for a pretty long time, and in my opinion it has become extremely prescriptivist. It is not a ""grassroots"" culture. It is a culture where there is a 'correct' prescribed viewpoint that the general populace is expected to adopt, and disagreeing with it is wrong and cancelable. Cancel culture is not popular, there has been a (recently lessening) fear that people have of openly opposing *any* views that are part of the progressive philosophy. As a result they have kind of flocked to these ideological spaces where it's 'okay' for them to say things that are, to them, completely obvious fundamental realities, and to be clear, I don't mean racist, insane, far-right takes, I mean even relatively benign traditionalist-leaning perspectives. Many of those spaces are wolves in sheep's clothing, but the left really enables them to adopt that disguise because in left spaces, you can't even oppose facets of policy on a tactical level without being treated as if you are assaulting the foundation of the societal good that the policy is idealistically aiming to resolve. That's an extremely alienating environment and essentially relies on participants to be willing to regularly swallow or suppress their individual perspective.",0

"Sorry, I shoved in a layer of knowledge in myth without explaining the underlying context. 

The Younger Dryas Impact Theory suggests we experienced a bombardment event from the disintegrating comet that formed the Taurid Meteor stream. 

We now have the tech to track the orbit of the large objects in all the meteor streams earth passes through and rewind their orbits in time until they all merge into their particular parent comet that originally entered the inner solar system.  

The Taurids originate from the parent comet Enke, which entered the inner solar system around 15-12k years ago. As it disintegrated, large objects bombarded earth during this time.  

The largest of these objects hit the North American ice caps, causing ocean amounts of melt water to run off the 2-3 mile high glaciers and flooded out most of the northern hemisphere at the end of the last ice age. 

The biblical flood happened in a sense. Even 200 foot sized pieces of this many mile sized disintegrating comet hitting the ocean, ice cap, and exploding in air bursts have explosive yields in the Megaton range. 

The theory is that prior civilization ended with a punctuation mark with Melt Water Pulse 1B.  When a critical mass of these melted the 2-3 mile thick glaciers on the planet, ending the ice age. 

We remember these events in myth, and the Western traditions have written these down on paper now, but make no mistake, those stories are passed from your ancestors.  Events in the sky were personified in the Greek tradition as stories of the Gods.

The Greek traditions say Apollo struck a mighty blow on Tauros the bull, that its blood rained down on earth and flooded it out.  

The vaporized water also rained out, in extreme quantities, maybe 40 days and nights? 

That is a much more scientific rendition of the Great Flood in the Bible.  The Rainbow promising not to flood the world like that again, is in reference to the fact the glaciers are no longer present on the planet to have that same kind of event again. 

Phaethon is a mythical rendition of a later event.  Phaethon was the mortal son of Apollo, the sun god.  He found out his dad was Apollo and asked him to drive the chariot for one day.  Apollo reluctantly granted his wish, but it spelled the end for Phaethon. 

The horses driving the chariot, sensing the new rider, ran the sun off course, burning the earth, Zeus, seeing the issue, struck Phaethon from the chariot with a lightning bolt and he fell to the Mediterranean and flooded out the region with a great tsunami, while the horses took the errant sun away. 

That event is the Burckle Crater (suspected) in the Indian ocean.  Something happened there in the last 5-6 thousand years.  Coincidentally, around the time most of the old world civilizations collapsed.",1

"Here's the other thing. MAGA is eager to reverse all Biden era legislation that invested in clean energy, infrastructure, environmental regulations and climate change initiatives in order to offset the extravagant cost of beefed up national security, Trump's ""mass deportation plan,"" and, of course, all those trillions in tax cuts that primarily benefit the rich and corporations, among other things..

*However,* not only will these cost cutting efforts fail to make up for this expensive agenda; neglecting to compensate for the massive loss in government revenue and a ballooning deficit, but these clean energy investments were just that, *investments.*

This campaign against all things ""green"" will cost money on its own. So much for ""fiscal conservatism."" 

So much for ""small government"" for that matter. 

As long as Republicans are ""owning the libs,"" their precious, so-called ""values"" mean nothing to them.

It's not just about rolling back time, but rolling back these investments in our future.

In an effort to ""save costs,"" which we all know is horseshit because this is more ideological than anything else, Republicans are costing this country, its taxpayers and its businesses money.

But it doesn't end there either. They're also costing us our future; preferring instead to invest in more drilling, mining and logging operations that will take up more public land while disrupting and/or reversing years of progress, innovation and developments in renewable energy projects and initiatives meant to wean us off of our addiction to fossil fuels and their affect on carbon emissions.

What's more, Republicans are also weakening our ability to compete with other countries that are still innovating, still funding research and still investing in these technologies and developments. Countries that aren't choosing to halt progress and backslide into a time period when people were exposed to enough toxic substances and pollutants to give them permanent brain damage.

Additionally, this also means more layoffs; the  dismantling of important government agencies; the end to regulations that helped improve, or at least preserve public health; the elimination of independent oversight; corrupt relationships between Republicans and special interests remaining undisturbed; and an ongoing transfer of wealth into the hands of corporations that lie in bed with this administration.",1

Dems also lack rhetoric and a narrative, Trump doesn’t have anything regarding policy but that doesn’t matter when he can say “drill baby drill” and an entire audience cheers him on like it means something. 

People don’t want to hear how good the economy’s doing or that we’ve bounced back better than our contemporaries, because that doesn’t matter to a family that are barely squeaking by with both adults working or being forced to have roommates into their 30s and 40s and up.",1

An excerpt Entomology Today from the article ""The Far-Reaching Harms of Cuts to Entomological Research, Part 1"":

""As dismissals and program closures mount at agencies like the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the ripple effects will include more pests in fields, fewer pollinators, rising food costs, and more invasive species harming native ecosystems. In fact, this year a new health crisis is threatening managed honey bees (Apis mellifera, shown here pollinating an almond blossom), and urgent research is needed to understand what is contributing to heavy winter die-offs.""

"&gt; ""Trump is going to run again after 2028"" (come the fuck on, no he wont, he's gonna be 82)

That's not why he won't run again in 2028. If there was nothing else going on, he'd run until the day he plopped down dead.

In 2028, either he'll a) already be dead, or b) he'll have served his two constitionally allowed terms and will retire to Mar-A-Lago to pull strings behind the scenes and tweet lots, or c) he'll have abolished voting and will be dictator for life, with Don Jr. queued up as his successor. 

In any case, in 2028 he'll either be dead, nominally out of power, or still be in power as something that isn't a President as we currently understand it.

Want to bet which of those it'll be?

"&gt; I can only assume I was unclear in my reply that I was talking about duly elected congresspeople, which caused confusion. If so my bad.

This! Wasn't clear, hence confusion.

&gt;We have evidence showing a clear pattern of Donald Trump not being willing to give up power

I'd argue you have evidence of the contrary actually. If he was unwilling to give up power wouldn't Joe Biden have never been president? I also don't attribute what supporters of a person do, necessarily, to the actions of the person themselves. We don't in law for example charge people with crimes like that unless there are very direct calls to action which is incitement. Note: J6 incitement was not charged. Meaning, there was likely not enough evidence to be considered to convict. Which... with a public speech kind of means it wasn't incitement.

&gt;  
He has also made statements about running for a third term, which would be unconstitutional.

There is only a hyper small subset of the right talking about this. It's dumb, I hate it. As a conservative leaning independent it doesn't represent the vast majority of those on the Right. I also think it would be unconstitutional.

&gt;  
He secured a SCOTUS decision that the president is immune from crimes for all ""official acts"" as well as established precedent that the DOJ shall not prosecute a sitting president.

This is such a nonsense thing, it's literally always been the case. For example, Obama ordered a drone strike to directly kill a US citizen. IE murder without due process of a US citizen. If this were not the case he could/should be in prison.

On your Trump quote, I don't read that quote literally. And when I saw him say it in the interview I was immediately shaking my head because I knew it would be taken out of context. I interpreted him saying this as essentially a joke: IE You (right leaning people) won't need to vote anymore because I believe there is fraud and if I fix the fraud the left doesn't have enough votes to win."" That was how I interpret that quote in context. Which you can disagree with the fraud, but it doesn't sound anything like a dictator.

&gt;You also have a majority of Republicans in Congress who refused to vote to impeach him solely on the grounds that they will not impeach a president who has not first been convicted of a crime in court,

This is LITERALLY, how the impeachment process works. They can vote whatever they want for any reason. For example, look at the Clinton impeachment he lied under oath. 100% not debatable. Democrats didn't confirm the impeachment. Was that wrong? I think ethically, yes. Legally, no.

Now I don't agree with your initial premise. I don't think they voted ONLY because he wasn't convicted yet. But i do think that was part of the reason. If it was the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to agree.

&gt;He has been purging the government of any and all ethics watchdogs whose job it is to ensure that the President acts according to the law, and has stacked every federal agency with unqualified goons who are blindly loyal to him, including the military.

What ethics watchdogs were purged? I find it hard to argue he's not having oversight when there are more legal challenges against him in the last 2 months than ever? There is oversight, the process is going through the courts. It's being done. I think they will mostly be overturned, you can and probably disagree but doesn't mean there isn't oversight.",0

Say the ice caps rapidly melt then the UK would be more at risk or inland flooding than coastal flooding - as sea levels rise river levels also rise and they become more prone to flooding in heavy rains.

That's especially true when talking about broad categories like ""Christians"" or ""Muslims"", because these groups have a much greater diversity of thought than you may realize. 

More likely than not, if you're judging a group based on their beliefs (or at least what you perceive to be their beliefs) there are certain specific beliefs that you consider to be the most egregious. At the very least, you should learn enough about that group to A) be certain that you accurately understand what the belief is, and B) that the belief in question is, in fact, universally held by members of that group.

Pre-judging a Klansman because you assume that they're racist makes sense, because racism is a defining trait of that group; you're not really making any assumptions there. Pre-judging a Christian because you assume that they're homophobic does not make sense, because that is not a defining trait of Christianity, even if several large denominations still have issues.",1

"The high price of GPUs is not at all due to the lack of adequate production/fab capacity in PRC China. Adding the latter would not change prices significantly. Instead, what's missing for making GPU prices drop is competition in the domain of GPU chip design with comparable performance.

Several PRC-Chinese firms also have advanced chips produced by TSMC in Taiwan already; if any PRC-Chinese firm developed a GPU comparable to those of NVidia or AMD, they could already have it produced by TSMC. 

And while a production within the PRC (if they obtained the EUVL technology) would be slightly cheaper than in Taiwan, that difference only accounts for a small fraction of the high price of GPUs, which is mostly due to enormous margins resulting from the shameless profiting from the duopoly situation: NVidia for example had a 73% gross margin in 2023 and projections of 75% for Q2/2025, and a net profit margin of 49% in 2023.

That being said, while we're at it: Both the design of high-performance CPUs and GPU (or more generally: high-performance matrix calculation chips, which are necessary e.g. for AI and increasingly for defense) and EUVL-level fab capacity are something that we Europeans are still lacking while we should have in the EU, both for strategic autonomy and for resilience to semiconductor crises and trade wars. As far as the fab side is concerned, We have ASML, Zeiss, Trumpf and a couple other manufacturers of crucial equipment for such EUVL-level fine structures, but we don't have any such fab yet.

"That’s a neat little story, but it’s exactly that—a story. One designed to make people feel better about massive inequality by blaming the victims of it.

Let’s be real: most rich people today didn’t start with nothing. They had access—whether it was inherited wealth, elite education, early investment opportunities, or a safety net that let them take risks without fear of going homeless. That’s not “wise choices.” That’s privilege leveraged into more privilege.

And the idea that poor people are broke because they buy “frivolous” things? It’s a lazy stereotype. Try living in poverty and see how “frivolous” a $5 fast food meal looks when you work two jobs and still can’t afford groceries or childcare. Most poor people stretch every dollar just to survive. They don’t have IRAs or trust funds—they have bills, inflation, and debt collectors breathing down their necks.

And as for this “rich would be rich again” line—sure, some would rise again. But the system is rigged to help them do exactly that. Insider access, tax loopholes, political influence—it’s not genius or hard work. It’s a ladder they climbed and then pulled up behind them.

Nobody’s asking for forced equality or communism. What we’re asking is why a tiny group gets to hoard trillions while the majority lives paycheck to paycheck. That’s not human nature. That’s manufactured inequality defended by people who benefit from pretending it’s just “how the world works.”

"So there's a problem when debating anti-climate change people.

The problem is that they aren't arguing in good faith to begin with.  There is NO science that says we aren't experiencing climate change as a result of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.  That science simply doesn't exist.  

So this person is intentionally lying, cherry picking data, willfully misinterpreting data, or some combination of the three.  It's hard to argue against that, because he has a deep seated desire to believe what he believes.  It's like arguing against the existence of God to someone deeply religious.  There's no facts or logic you can bring up.

Also - the most skilled anti-science people are going to just throw questions at you until you give up.  They will say ""here's a fact"" and you will say ""no, that's wrong, here is proof.""  Then they will say ""fine, here's another fact"" and you will say ""nope, wrong again, here is proof.""  Then they will do it again, and again.  And we aren't perfect experts, so one day he will say ""here's a fact"" and you will probably figure that he's wrong but you won't have the knowledge to refute it in that moment, and he will claim victory.  

There's a great example of that with holocaust deniers.  One random thing they bring up is something like ""so they said the gas chambers were built to kill people in WW2.  But the paint that has been sampled and found in those chambers wasn't manufactured until 1953!!!  So it's a hoax!!!""  And you can't possibly know anything about what paint was sampled from where, and when various paint was manufactured.  So they say ""ah ha!! See?? You can't disprove my paint logic, therefore the holocaust was a hoax!!!""

Anyway, in short, when you argue against someone invested in lies, it's hard to be the one who has to always speak the truth, when the other person can just invent fiction on their side.",0

Mexico has been investing in their CIIT, which is a train to connect the Pacific and Atlantic. Maybe not a replacement for the panama Canal or NW Passage, but a way to skip the toll. 

The two highest volume routes connect the East Coast of the US to the Far East and the West Coast of the US to Europe.

"&gt; Basically, Buckley was brought by groups on various parts of the political spectrum, such as labor unions, small conservative parties, the libertarian party, etc. They deciphered that incumbents held electoral advantage (true), so they needed to outraise those incumbents to adequately challenge them. Restricting their ability to fundraise effectively ""restricted their political speech"", they argued, and the SCOTUS agreed. 

This is a pretty poor representation of the case.  The expenditure limits were nuked because, as the opinion noted, they ""reduce[d] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of the exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.""

You cannot have free speech while removing the tools in which to do so.  You can't ban a printing press by saying ""it's fine, you can still shout from the street corner.""

&gt; The leftwing groups (e.g. unions) should have absolutely known better, but they just flat out missed the danger here. Very clearly with unlimited fundraising, rich people can dominate politics. 

It's not that they missed out on the danger, it's that the danger was *to them* if they were kept from being able to spend money to advocate for their membership.

&gt; Again, Citizens United doesn't have a case if not for Buckley; the argument that ""money is speech"" didn't exist - or at least wasn't a recognized concept by the Supreme Court - until Buckley.

This is false.  *Bigelow v. Virginia* came before *Buckley*, and recognized first amendment protections for commercial speech. *United States v. O'Brien* before that established the test for expressive communication versus particular conduct, noting that ""the governmental interests advanced in support of [campaign expenditure restrictions] involve 'suppressing communication.'""

SCOTUS additionally pointed to time, place, and manner restrictions as not analogous, noting again that the campaign finance restrictions in front of them ""impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed.""

&gt; McCutcheon, (2014) however, then opened the floodgates even further by eliminating all restrictions on total aggregate donations by individuals towards political campaigns. Before McCutcheon, individuals could still only donate a certain amount to campaigns, and overall political spending (say, donating to multiple campaigns) was also capped. Not after McCutcheon!

Correct.  This was the right decision, because the aggregate limits were wholly arbitrary as is and made no sense, especially in the wake of *Citizens United*.  As Chief Justice Roberts noted, ""The government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.""

&gt; And in terms of ""bad application of [legal] logic,"" McCutcheon is worse than Citizens United, as it basically argues that allowing unlimited aggregate donations couldn't contribute to corruption. Just obviously false. 

If it's so obviously false, why do campaign finance advocates have such difficulty in proving it?",0

"Sure it is. Humans didn't use fossil fuels for the majority of human existence. 

The real question is can humans stop using fossil fuels and continue to enjoy a high standard of living or even continue to increase their standard of living. 

The answer is yes. Renewable energy and nuclear energy have every capability of replacing the fossil fuels for both industrial heat applications and commercial energy production. Sometimes they are marginally more expensive, sometimes marginally less expensive, but we are not really talking game breaking economic differences. 

Liquid fuels become trickier, but a transition to electrical vehicles and using synthetic diesel/gas for heavy duty applications is absolutely possible, if somewhat more expensive. 

In short, yes we can stop using fossil fuels. Why don't we? Because our economic system rewards short term profit and does not price in externalities. Our political system allows wealthy and entrenched interests to rig the regulatory environment against competitive technologies.

The funniest facts to me is that we hail native american wisdom for so many things but then completely diregard it when it comes to tobacco and villify it based on studies by the same people that sold it sprayed with all sorts of chemicals.  Tobacco is a natural insecticide and one of the best plants to plant next to crops.  Plus it has been found to have **anti-cancer** properties, especially for kidneys.  

And for climate...I mean we are talking about people that still call these things ""fossil"" fuels even though the farthest a fossil has wver been found is 16,000 feet below, and oil has been found deeper than 60,000 feet below.  It all started with a scientist hired by Rockefeller who at a conference over a century ago explained it as a fossil fuel and the lie continues today (because the influence still exists today, Rockefeller was the richest person on the planet and dominated oil and steel).  The same oil companies that raised their prices based off this lie and the lie that the second most common liquid on this planet is running out now are trying to sell the idea of people still being the problem and their profits needing to be higher as they raise prices more and more and more.

Crazy. If only dozens of them could make those visits on one vehicle instead of multiple. Guess we'll never know.


It is actually insane to ignore how the sheer lack of transit worsens the climate crisis. If we want a future, we need busses, trains, subways, etc etc etc. Good news is that people do largely want this. People DO want to drive less. Thank god, because convincing numerous residents of a miserable society to give up their moments of leisure, sounds borderline impossible.

"The cause-effect relations you are describing appear to be highly simplified. The predictions of the gulf stream shutting down are based on modeling the earth and running simulations on computers of these models. Because the earth (oceans, land, atmosphere) is complex, the modelers have to make sweeping assumptions, the accuracy of these predictions, therefore, depend on the fidelity of the models (how close they are to the truth). To my knowledge, there is almost no verification or evaluation of these assumptions and simplifications. The scientists who publish the predictions do not enumerate them, the journalists, politicians and hordes of 'climatologists' who quote these predictions do not demand them. They remain a black box.

To appreciate how complex it is to model the planet, take a look at books and courses on the topic.

[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/12-950-atmospheric-and-oceanic-modeling-spring-2004/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fundamentals-of-atmospheric-modeling/A6B866737D682B17EE46F8449F76FB2C](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/12-950-atmospheric-and-oceanic-modeling-spring-2004/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fundamentals-of-atmospheric-modeling/A6B866737D682B17EE46F8449F76FB2C)

I would also recommend looking up the original work of [Wallace Broecker ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Smith_Broecker)who was the first to claim that according to his 'simulation', the ocean conveyors may slow down or stop, if the earth's temperature went up just a few degrees. There has been no publicly available evaluation of Broecker's assumptions and simplifications either.

In short, while the warming of the planet is measurable, the predictions of ocean currents stopping, storms happening as a result, are not verified by anyone other than the scientists themselves (aka peer review). Given that these scientists do have an incentive to claim that their predictions are accurate (otherwise they will not receive government money in the future), their insider-reviews are not very reliable.

I encourage you to delve more into modeling and simulation techniques, and evaluate their veracity and reliability for yourself.",1

&gt;Aerobic biodegradation has the advantage of achieving high temperatures, which will destroy many pathogens that desiccation cannot (3).

"Unfortunately, the final world war begins this year as it has been planned for a long time. It was meant to take place on 21/12/2012 but unfortunately this date was pushed back for reasons largely unknown. I think it was to first see how willing people would be to obey their governments’ orders if they were all instructed to remain in their homes during the outbreak of a nuclear war. So basically COVID lockdown was to see if the majority of people in the world would obey their governments’ orders to remain in their homes; this was deemed to be mostly successful and now when the war begins, there will be a much higher probability that they will be able to wipe out as much life as possible given that people will voluntarily remain as prisoners in their own homes. 

The purpose of the final world war is global depopulation to reduce humanity to less than 500 million so they can be more easily controlled. This is why all the billionaires and very rich celebrities have been building bunkers quickly during these past few years; however, there already exists hundreds of underground cities that will be safe places - some call them deep underground military bunkers - all around the world; the majority of which have predominantly been built by the Americans, and these will house all those who have already been pre-selected. This is a worldwide agreement between all the major heads of countries, which has been long planned ever since the time that the Americans first made contact with the non-dimensional entities during the prelude to the Cold War. These entities gave the leaders of the Five Eyes’ countries a choice, either greatly depopulate earth’s population to make humanity easier to control or everyone gets wiped out to begin the next cycle of humanity. We are currently on the 6th cycle because past civilizations all failed to completely adhere to this demand. This is why there is such widespread evidence of past structures all around the world of having been built using incredibly advanced technologies that mainstream archaeology has been instructed to suppress. So the final deadline for the global war to begin is 31/12/2025 and 31/12/2028 for the vast majority of humanity to be wiped out. How do I know all this to be true? Not everyone will die but the vast majority must; so why should anyone have to worry now if the majority of humanity tries to suddenly stop a global plan that has almost reached its end point? 

Trump knows of the global agenda and it was only he who requested the release of all highly classified documents on such very sensitive topics as the JFK assassination and 9/11 etc. because any potential backlash that anyone might now receive from the release of such sensitive documents would be considered negligible given the fact that the vast majority of humanity will no longer exist from this year onwards. However, there have been many people that have had to be prevented from disclosing the global plan, such as the Area 51 caller on Art Bell, Phil Schneider, and very recently, a certain TikTok user - amongst many others.

Biden also knew of the global agenda and he was instructed to break down civilization with the woke ideology as this has been widely done before many times throughout history prior to the collapse of an empire.

US after breaking off of the British empire became a better world. *For the white man.* Was it a fair a just world? No. They had slaves.

They were still devided by race, as there were places where ""colored people"" could simply not go, such as *fucking bathrooms.*

US in 1964 (when segregation of public facilities was outlawed) became a better world. *There were no more public facilities restricted for black people.* Is it a fair and just world? No. There are people dying in the streets because they can't afford insuline.

"Yes, intergrades of all sorts do exist in the wild and we even recognize some of them as a somewhat distinct population (see red wolves), but they’re generally the exceptions that occur along the periphery of “normal” conditions for the populations. Such as three-toed and painted box turtle integrades where the extents of their ranges overlap. 

But a key part of this is that the two integraded species are recognized as distinct species and are reproductively isolated through the majority of their range and the conditions the species occurs. 

This is still not true for the “dire wolves” in this story where you have a distinct population of grey wolves and this artificial population of artificial grey wolves. If they were allowed to come into contact in nature, I’d bet everything that the artificial dire wolf population, the ones that survive, immediately get assimilated into grey wolf populations and largely disappear. Maintaining the grey wolf as a distinct species. 

Kind of in the same fashion evidence suggest Homo sapiens assimilated Neanderthal. 

TLDR: Which is all just a very long winded way to say hybrids (intergrades) exist at the edge of speciation events, and are the exceptions that prove the rules. Either they become a distinct species that is reproductively isolated where they occur or they continue to exist only as artifact at the edge of suitable conditions for otherwise distinct species that continue to be distinct throughout the majority of their range.",0

If you're at the stage of being able to send large amounts of stuff to found a colony on Venus you'd also be at the stage of being able to drag asteroids into orbit for disassembly.

"I think the best case scenario is that at some point we use tech to enhance our bodies/brains to be able to have access to all of our knowledge whenever we want it, and be aided by our AIs in managing all of it, and make political and economic decisions through a direct democracy. But it'll be more of a data testing/validation exercise, because we all have access to the same data and how different are we really going to be at that point. Survival seems like a goal we'd still be interested in. So we'd colonize other planets for matter to make more computers and other devices for our AIs to use to solve problems related to our survival. Including eventually dealing with preventing whatever end of the universe scenario we determine may happen without our intervention.",1
"Ahh yes, those ultra generous energy companies. Do you think the private sector would have built the interstate highway system too?

"Lol! Yes, and I'm offering that human culture is a player in that system. It isn't just as easy as ""grab a few friends and do what you love!"" I do feel some intentionality is required. However, let's use meat as an example. I eat meat and like so many others don't cherish things like animal harm, factory farms etc. but I've been far more successful cutting meat out than completely doing away with it. As well, I get all hyped on the impact I'm going to have and then well, I don't really feel like anything is changing. The message is still that climate change is my fault and I'm not doing enough. Compare that to me hosting a meatless night for family, friends, coworkers, etc. Or, if you fed 365 people a vegan meal in one night that is worth one year of you doing it. We begin to see joyful, hopeful, tangible efforts that are very sustainable. Those things are essentially anti-capitalist.

"TL;DR:
What we’re living through isn’t dysfunction—it’s a long-running strategy of control. Intelligence agencies and the military-industrial complex stopped serving the public decades ago. They now operate as a shadow government, enriching themselves through global criminal networks, black budgets, and endless war. Their true enemy isn’t foreign—it’s us.

They destabilize countries, overthrow democratic leaders, and prop up fascist regimes for profit. At home, they run surveillance states, control media narratives, and use AI to manipulate behavior. Division, addiction, and despair aren’t accidents—they’re engineered.

Mass shootings, culture wars, and collapsing communities are symptoms of deliberate social atomization. All to keep us too distracted and overwhelmed to resist. While we fight over scraps, elites consolidate power, extract wealth, and prepare to relocate when this system fully collapses.

China outplayed us economically and strategically while our leadership sold out. Now, the intelligence apparatus is fractured—some fighting for control, others just trying to survive. But it was never about Left vs. Right. It’s Top vs. Bottom. Human vs. Machine. Until we unplug and rediscover solidarity, they keep winning.",1

"While putting a laser on the moon would negate atmospheric interference, it brings in a whole host of problems of its own. 

For one, the sheer distance involved, as the moon is almost 384000km away, and an ICBM only really goes out to a few thousand kilometers. Trying to target something that far and keeping the laser beam focused is gonna be nearly impossible. Youre far better off building a laser in orbit instead, even with the difficulty of radiating heat. 

Lasers in general as ICBM defense arent a great idea tbh. You ideally want to catch the missile while its in the boost phase (when its has a bright IR signature from the main engine, is a big and vulnerable target, and none of the warheads have deployed), but its very short (a few minutes), and since its ends relatively close to the earth you might not be able to even target it if where theyre launching from isnt on the near side. After that stage you have more time, but also youre gonna be dealing with decoys and multiple warheads; thats going mean orders of magnitude more targets for you to deal with, with the added bonus that these targets are much much smaller and ""cold"" (thus much harder to detect).",1
"&gt; I think using a total of 5 minutes from a press conference like that is disingenuous when observing their behavior as a whole.

Often, I find Moon hoaxers will present just a few stills and short clips to make their point that the press conference was some awkward mess. The clips I’ve provided serve to demonstrate that the other point of view is disingenuous and neglects a lot that contradicts its core claim.

Nonetheless, if you have an interest in the Apollo Program and/or the Apollo 11 mission, I recommend watching the [press conference in its entirety](https://youtu.be/hzn_Lu9B284?si=mu_hNKOPkXav-qLu).

&gt;Back to the press conference even if you’re not assuming they just got back I don’t know how you can convince any socially aware person that they were acting normal. I feel like if you say they were you’re ignoring the obvious

*Simple:* They were having a problem that most people alive do, that they’re not particularly good at public speaking, especially when there’s an audience right in front of them. Their job wasn’t one of public relations spokesmen, they were test pilots, who earned their wings as astronauts.

For example, Armstrong at many points will stumble over his words, pausing as he mentally feels his way forward as he structures together a sentence. This is something I do on the spot sometimes, as I attempt to word a sentence on the fly, and it doesn’t end up coming out as coherently as it should, resulting in me having to change gears a bit in the middle of the sentence.

In short - The only conclusion isn’t that they’re upset about keeping some conspiracy going, their behavior is that of individuals not adept at making big public appearances.

&gt; I understand the van allen belts weren’t a barrier but we had never successfully sent anything through them alive.

We didn’t need to send organisms through the belts to discern the danger they pose, we had geiger counters aboard unmanned probes that do exactly that.

&gt; Legitimately just think about the odds of us succeeding on our first try and then 6 times after that over 50 years ago.

I don’t know what you mean by “first try”, as the Van Allen belts were already well known about, having been discovered by the [Explorer 1 probe in 1958](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_1), and further research had been conducted on subsequent flights. Likewise, the Van Allen belts were understood by mission planners for the Apollo Program.

The flights also weren’t a “first try”, exemplified by the first Moon landing not being Apollo 1. Apollo 4, 5, and 6 were uncrewed flights of the command module, lunar module, and Saturn V upper stage respectively, and Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 10 were crewed flights that incrementally tested and evaluated the spacecraft and navigation techniques, so by the time Apollo 11 passed through the Van Allen belts and touched down on the lunar surface, we had done it numerous times and knew that everything was designed properly and implemented correctly. Do recall, however, that the number *should* be 7 Moon landings, as Apollo 13’s exploding O2 tank resulted in the astronauts having to abort the mission.",1
"Taxing things that generate CO2 or methane causes people to use them less, or stop using them entirely. That's the basis of carbon taxes, the economist-approved method for stopping climate change. 

In terms of actually using the money, renewables are already the cheapest way to add power to a grid, so that's taking care of base load power on its own. The technology to decarbonize the electric grid is fully mature, it's just not as cheap as continuing to run the old power plants while more no/low carbon capacity comes online. 

Transport is maturing in the direction of low-carbon options already - the hard targets are freight shipping and jet travel, which do not currently have sustainable all-electric options, but do have (expensive) biofuel options that are low-carbon. Money could be used to switch oil and gas production towards those needs instead of refining fossil fuels. Simply mandating that those fuels be used would just cause an economic crisis - you need subsidies to get those industries up and running as well as carbon taxes to make their prices favorable, while still keeping goods and people moving. 

That leaves the last hard lump: heating (which can be electrified pretty easily, it's more efficient anyway) and industrial uses. *Most* industrial processes have electric alternatives, though they tend to be fairly energy-intensive (and thus more expensive than carbon sources). Subsidizing electrification of industrial technology would go a long way towards reducing the overall carbon budget. File non-fossil production of plastics and fertilizer under this heading as well.

All of that *stops more carbon going in*. It does not take it out of the system, which is what's got us to 1.2 (and likely up to 1.5) already. The biofuels are simply low-carbon or carbon neutral. Taking it out of the air requires either geoengineering, which is very expensive, or carbon sinks, like planting bamboo, letting it grown, then cutting it down and storing it somewhere it won't rot (coal mines are common recommendations). 

Until/unless we have abundant, no-carbon power, literally filtering it out of the air isn't the best use of power, but every pound of greenhouse gases averted makes the problem smaller and easier to solve (thus why economists like carbon taxes). 

The broadest problem is popular support: most people in the world believe that climate change is real, even if they don't fully understand the science, but *they* don't want to pay to fix it, even if the cost is relatively minor. We could soak the rich (after all, they produce the most carbon, as a class) and since carbon taxes are functionally consumption taxes it would probably do quite a bit, under classical models of microeconomics. The ""standard"" solution to this problem is diverting most of the money raised by carbon taxes towards subsidizing poor people so that the impact of the taxes is lessened a bit (i.e. nobody starves or freezes because of a carbon tax eating into their income). But conservatives have successfully demonized the idea of public subsidy in the Anglosphere, if not the world generally, to avoid paying taxes wherever possible. 

If there's a nonviolent solution to that, there's probably a Nobel prize in it for you.",1

"One thing that always has to be discussed with climate change goals is ""over what period of time"". Humans contribute to climate change but the world would have increased its temp by 1.5c eventually with or without human intervention. The question is how long could we keep the temperature down for. The sun is burning hotter and the temp has been increasing for many thousands of years. If we are looking only at the last few thousand years then we are only looking at a period where we are comimg out of an ice age. Technically we are actually still in an ice age as the earth has not had ice caps for about 80% of its history.",1
"Fireplace? That's another reason for a gas line. Might as well throw in a gas boiler and a gas line for a plumbed in BBQ / firepit too, pool heater, furnace for the shop/garage, etc. 
Sure you can run this all on electricity but once you add in two electric car chargers you may be bumping past 200A.

Gas stoves are more flexible and can cook with all kinds of cookware, and they dont care if your pans are warped, aluminum, clay , or tinfoil.  You can slide your heavy pots around without lifting,  and drop things on it , etc. There are also much larger gas stoves available  with  built in charbroilers and griddles. 

A good gas stove will easily outlast an induction. It needs a cleaning once in a while but theres basically no electronics .  You do have to ensure you have adequate ventilation / hood fan and put the gas stove into a seperate room for good measure. 

There are still good use cases for gas. Not in apartments  but in larger single family homes where you can have multiple gas appliances.",1

"The amount of money, technology, and research that would go into colonizing another planet is hard to fathom. So are the rewards that would come from it. 

Think about the advances in agriculture, water purification, waste recycling, robotics, material science, solar/nuclear/battery technology, etc. Those will all have direct applications to earth. 

You might ask, ""Why not just invest that into earth?"" If the technology is transferable, why does it matter what the original intention is? It all goes towards advancing our knowledge and giving us more tools to survive. Plus, the excitement of solving novel problems is what inspires people to produce truly revolutionary ideas.

Additionally, one of the biggest problems we're facing on earth is climate change. Within that problem, our climate models would benefit massively from more data. Mars was rendered inhospitable because of severe climate change. Having the data of what happened will greatly benefit our models on earth. But we need infrastructure on the ground to fully paint that picture. But not only that, any actions done to restore an atmosphere will give us even more data that we can use. 

The knowledge that we could gain from such an endeavor is far more valuable than any similar size investment we could make on earth.",1

Having a military is also not ""symbolic"". Take the US military--arguably the strongest in the world, and certainly the best funded.

And we couldn't win against a bunch of untrained desert lunatics in Afghanistan, despite killing 10 of them for every one of us that died. Having the best military on paper doesn't min you automatically win every war.

The Afghanistan paramilitary is certainly not ""symbolic"" despite being relatively tiny and poorly funded.

Another important role of the military is handling terrorism and piracy. Take Somalian pirates, who raid international shipping routes. The world united to eliminate the threat through military force, and Somalia is a significantly lesser threat than it used to be.",0

Ask one and they'll regurgitate some basic talking points, and they won't be able to give any details about what sort of impact we should expect from whatever policies they vaguely describe. They voted for tariffs to fight (already resolved) inflation.

"The primary issues is textual variation. Manuscripts discovered from different periods and regions show discrepancies, with some passages added, others omitted, and certain phrases altered. This is evident in the differences between major biblical codices, such as the Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, and later medieval versions, which often contain conflicting details. Moreover, translations into Greek, Latin, and other languages introduced further complexities, sometimes modifying meanings or adapting texts to align with specific theological perspectives.

Another challenge is the absence of an original, singular version of the Bible (often believed to be Aramaic or Syria). Unlike a text that is preserved in a consistent form, the Bible exists in multiple versions—such as the Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox canons—each with variations in the number of books and specific content. This multiplicity raises concerns about authenticity and the ability to determine what was originally revealed versus what was later modified by human intervention.

Given these factors, reaching the original message of the Bible becomes nearly impossible before even considering its translations into modern languages. This situation presents a significant theological and historical dilemma: if divine revelation is meant to guide humanity, shouldn't its core text remain intact and free from alteration? That’s why it’s better to find a book that has been perfectly preserved forever.",1

"You’ve brought a well-structured argument here, and I appreciate the depth. But I think there’s a critical gap in the reasoning: it assumes that voter choice operates in a vacuum, when in reality, it’s heavily shaped by the very systems that claim to represent it.

Yes, Trump’s rise represents a significant shift in the Republican Party—but it’s also the product of decades of carefully cultivated media ecosystems, targeted misinformation, and emotional manipulation. If the parties are responding to voters, it’s worth asking: who shaped those voters’ perceptions in the first place?

You mentioned that “the parties do what it takes to win votes”—which is true—but that pursuit of victory often involves manufacturing outrage, simplifying complex issues, and reducing democratic discourse to spectacle. My argument isn’t that nothing ever changes—it’s that what we’re calling “choice” is often an illusion, filtered through systems designed to preserve elite interests.

You also said there’s “nothing sensationalist or divisive by design”—but I’d argue that political consultants, media firms, and ad networks have explicitly built their strategies around exploiting division because it drives engagement. Polarization isn’t just a reflection of ideological difference—it’s been weaponized for profit and power.

And while it’s true that Democrats have chosen more status quo candidates, that isn’t just because voters preferred them. It’s also because candidates advocating real systemic change are routinely undermined by the very institutions that claim to be democratic—from debate access to media bias to donor backing.

So yes, voters technically “choose” their representatives. But we need to talk about how those choices are shaped, limited, and manipulated long before a ballot is ever cast. Until we do, the conversation about change will always feel incomplete.",1

"&gt; Editing 14 genes of a grey wolf in my layman opinion is not enough to say that this isn't still just a grey wolf. I could be wrong about that so to any biologists reading this, please correct me if I'm wrong.

What is your basis for believing this exactly?

Why is 14 not the correct number according to you?

Some **actual** experts **actually** took real samples and **actually** compared them to determine the number of changes they thought were needed.  Now they might be wrong and only time will tell based on how that wolf grows up etc, but where the hell fo you get the confidence to flat out reject their expertise ""just becasue""? 

&gt; Imagine if you genetically modified a gorilla to look like a human, but it still behaved and thought like a gorilla. Would that really be a human?

Well humans are pretty special in that our brains are what makes us more or less entirely unique amongst the animal kingdom.  There would be good reason to expect a human carried to term by a gorilla to be messed up by the process, and that's if the huge head doesn't cause compression issues or if the rough movement of the mother gorilla doens't result in brain injury etc given how much more fragile humans are. 

But I really don't think there is good reason to presume vast differences between one type of wolf and another type of wolf.  They more or less operate within the same biological niche and since we don't know much about how the originals lived I doubt we'd notice any differences if there were any.

&gt;I bet this will more likely lead to ""extinct animal"" zoos (basically Jurassic Park), and probably in the long run the ability to genetically engineer humans.

Being able to bring back a bunch of species to study and ""play"" with genetics is a natural step in learning about those processes and differences in detail.

"Strange that you're downvoting mathematical, scientific reality. Especially so, given that it's simple math.

Let's take an extreme example... let's say we burn so much carbon, converting it to CO2 then sequestering 100% of that CO2, that we totally remove all O2 from the atmosphere.

We have to account for the atoms and molecules which that O2 displaces. We'll do the calculations for the three most-prevalent atomic or molecular species.

﻿209441.21395198 ppm O2 to start --&gt; 0 ppm O2 to end

Ar | 39.948 g mol-1 | 20.7862 J mol-1 K-1 | 18.846929895790 K km-1  
﻿﻿(Ar) 209441.21395198 ppm \* 0.00934 = 1956.1809383114 ppm  
﻿﻿(Ar) 9340 ppm + 1956.1809383114 ppm = 11296.180938311 ppm

﻿﻿﻿N2 | 28.0134 g mol-1 | 29.12 J mol-1 K-1 | 9.4339738283240 K km-1  
﻿﻿(N2) 209441.21395198 ppm \* 0.780761158 = 163523.56473807 ppm  
﻿﻿(N2) 780761.158 ppm + 163523.56473807 ppm = 944284.72273807 ppm

﻿﻿CO2 | 44.0095 g mol-1 | 36.94 J mol-1 K-1 | 11.683426182319 K km-1  
﻿(CO2) 209441.21395198 ppm \* 0.00043 = 90.059721999351 ppm  
﻿(CO2) 430 ppm + 90.059721999351 ppm = **520.05972199935 ppm**

So if we were to burn enough carbon that all O2 was converted to CO2, then all of that CO2 was sequestered, the atmosphere would have a CO2 concentration of **520 ppm**.

And that's with us putting **no CO2** into the atmosphere. CO2 concentration per parcel of air rises strictly and solely because we're removing other atmospheric constituents (in this case, O2) which dilute that CO2 already existing in the atmosphere.",0

"I have four reasons ranging from the next few decades, next few centuries, next millennia, to so far in the future it’s unfathomable. But all very rational reasons why not only I believe it should happen but it will become a must.

1) Untapped resources and unrestricted mining. We already are seeing billionaires drooling over the idea of colonizing mars. You think that’s really for the greater good of humanity? No. It’s a world free of any environment you could damage and chalk full of minerals. It’s been talked about so much I don’t think there’s any future where we don’t have a sizeable population living off earth. This is think will be some time in the next few decades to century. Money pushes the world forward. 

2) climate change, what better testing ground for terraforming than in small Martian colonies for piecing together the cluster fuck of earth or what remains of it in the next century or so? Also a good hold out for the billionaires wanting to live like kings than on a world all their own?

3) cosmic dangers, we have evidence on earth of apocalyptic meteorites hitting earth multiple times during the billion years of life on earth nearly ending it all. Can humans survive? Possibly, I even dare say probably but do we really know? Are we even remotely prepared for that situation? No, colonization would exponentially expand our chances of humanity’s survival. Especially if we experience a gamma ray burst. While statistically negligible if one did hit earth that would be it for humanity. Colonies on other planets are the only chance of humanity’s survival. And again I think the existence of both points one and two kind of guarantee that there will be. 

4) this final point is insanely far in the future, if humanity survives The Great Filter. In fact we probably wouldn’t be humans at this point but inevitably the sun is going to die, before that it will expand and devour earth, by that point we will have to have moved off earth to survive. Now I’m an optimist and believe we are capable of making it to that point, but at that point it’s inevitable.

Now I’m almost certain the self interest of the uber wealthy will have us colonizing other planets ASAP but for the ultimate survival of humanity or who ever inherits the earth after us it will be a necessity.",1

So Trump talking as he does sounds idiotic (I certainly thought that for a while) then I realised why he does it and why it works. Likewise Musk buying twitter and torching the company actually enabled him to turn it into a gargantuan mouthpiece for him and his ideas. 

They do make mistakes for sure. A good recent example of this is Musk saying some very unpopular things about H1B visas.

You talk about man-made irreversible realities. And by collapse you mean a fundamental change.   
  
But also that has always been the case and is an inevitable perpetual process. Ideas change our perception. Inventions change our living space. But is it not also true that we are just a phenomenon of our era and change will come for us in one way or the other anyways? What separates us from all that has evolved earlier? And is it not a pretty static point of view that evolving into something new is a ""collapse""? Things change. We can embrace that. In fact trying to stop that is maybe even worse - why would we want to stop the dynamic of life, evolution (call it whatever you want)?  
What might be bad for us could very well be beneficial for others and open new niches from which other great things might emerge.

That law has no mechanism to adjudicate whether any use of force in question actually falls under the AUMF. As long as Trump says it has something to do with al-Qaeda, probably if he just says that whatever he’s doing is under the AUMF, then that’s it. 

We’ve already been down the road of using the AUMF for a purpose that was explicitly not authorized - going after ISIS, which had absolutely no connection to 9/11, none to Al-Qaeda, and was in fact actively hostile to them. Nobody complained back then because we had to deal with those guys, but Obama should have sought a new authorization.

The army could just say “nah, we’re not doing that, it isn’t covered”, but that would be extra-legal since they have no say under the law. Congress could revoke the AUMF, but the republicans probably won’t. 

It’s highly likely that it won’t come to that with Denmark, but the problem isn’t that he can attack this specific country, it’s that he’s allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and was legally enabled to do so. It isn’t even a partisan issue, both parties have been happy to sell our freedoms in the name of security for decades, and it’s only now that people are getting upset about it.",0

"Germany still produces steel, wich produces a lot of CO2 with the current technology (blast furnace), this alone makes up a significant portion of germanies CO2 emissions.

However there are new facilities under construction that will use coal (coke) to reduce iron ore to iron wich gets converted into steel, but use hydrogen as a reduction agent.

One way or another, we need steel for a lot of things.

And imported steel is even worse due to the long distance it needs to be transported as well as lower efficiency blast-furnaces and often lower quality steel.

(also some german blast-furnaces have been modified to use some hydrogen to supplement the coke in order to reduce CO2 emissions)

Plus processing steel is also very, very energy intensive.

Germany is also in the process of phasing out coal for electricity production, wich is now progressing rapidly due to the expansion of renewables and we already have a fixed deadline.

However it seems that even before the deadline, coal will be mostly phased out and replaced by renewables, except for reserve powerplants that are for emergency use only.",0

**All real-world processes are irreversible processes, including radiative energy transfer, because radiative energy transfer is an entropic temporal process.**

Their mathematical fraudery is what led to their ‘energy can flow willy-nilly without regard to radiation energy density gradient‘ narrative (in their keeping with the long-debunked Prevost Principle), which led to their ‘backradiation‘ narrative, which led to their ‘CAGW‘ narrative, all of it definitively, mathematically, scientifically proven to be fallacious.

Now, they use that wholly-fictive ""*backradiation*"" to claim that this causes the ""*greenhouse effect (due to backradiation)*"", which they use to designate polyatomics (and it's always polyatomics... they had to use radiative molecules to get their ""*backradiation*"" scam to work... monoatomics have no vibrational mode quantum states and thus cannot emit (nor absorb) IR in any case; and homonuclear diatomics have a net-zero electric dipole which must be perturbed via collision in order to emit (or absorb) IR, except collisions occur exponentially less frequently as altitude increases due to air density exponentially decreasing with altitude) as ""*greenhouse gases (due to the greenhouse effect (due to backradiation))*"".

They then use that to claim certain of those polyatomics cause AGW / CAGW (Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming, due to CO2), from which springs all the offshoots of AGW / CAGW: net zero, carbon footprint, carbon credit trading, carbon capture and sequestration, degrowth, total electrification, banning ICE vehicles, replacing reliable baseload generation with intermittent renewables, etc.

Except ""*backradiation*"" is **physically impossible**. Energy does  not and cannot spontaneously flow up an energy density gradient.

Thus the ""*greenhouse effect (due to backradiation)*"" is **physically impossible**.

Thus ""*greenhouse gases (due to the greenhouse effect (due to backradiation))*"" are **physically impossible**.

Thus AGW / CAGW is **physically impossible**.

Thus all of the offshoots of AGW / CAGW are based upon a **physical impossibility**.

It starts with the climatologists confusing idealized blackbody objects and real-world graybody objects, which causes them to cling (knowingly or unknowingly) to the long-debunked Prevost Principle from 1791, which postulates that an object's radiant exitance is determined solely by that object's absolute temperature, therefore that all objects &gt; 0 K emit, therefore that energy flows willy-nilly without regard to the energy density gradient.

Because of this, they misuse the Stefan-Boltzmann (S-B) equation in their Energy Balance Climate Models (EBCMs) (which I prove using the Kiehl-Trenberth 'Earth Energy Balance' graphic, which is a graphical representation of the mathematical results in their EBCM).

There are two forms of the S-B equation:

[https://i.imgur.com/QErszYW.gif](https://i.imgur.com/QErszYW.gif)

\[1\] Idealized Blackbody Object form (assumes emission to 0 K and ε = 1 by definition):

q\_bb = **ε** σ (T\_h\^4 - **T\_c\^4**)

= **1** σ (T\_h\^4 - **0 K**)

= σ T\^4

\[2\] Graybody Object form (assumes emission to &gt; 0 K and ε &lt; 1):

q\_gb = ε σ (T\_h\^4 - T\_c\^4)

[https://i.imgur.com/V2lWC3f.png](https://i.imgur.com/V2lWC3f.png)

Climatologists misuse the S-B equation, using the idealized blackbody form of the equation upon real-world graybody objects. This essentially isolates each object into its own system so objects cannot interact via the ambient EM field, it assumes emission to 0 K, and it thus artificially inflates radiant exitance of all calculated-upon objects. Thus the climatologists must carry these incorrect values through their calculations and cancel them on the back end to get their equation to balance, subtracting a wholly-fictive 'cooler to warmer' **energy flow** from the real (but too high because it was calculated for emission to 0 K) 'warmer to cooler' **energy flow**.

That wholly-fictive 'cooler to warmer' **energy flow** is otherwise known as '*backradiation*'. It is nothing more than a mathematical artifact due to the misuse of the S-B equation. It does not and cannot exist. Its existence would imply rampant violations of the fundamental physical laws (energy spontaneously flowing up an energy density gradient in violation of 2LoT).

"Nuclear (fission) is the best sustainable energy source we have. The main problem with cost is that the public is too fearful of nuclear. 

Most of the expense of nuclear plants is the overabundance of safety features built into them. Increasing production will unlock economies of scale that should reduce this cost. Additionally, regulatory reform needs to happen to make sure safety measures are reasonable. 

Coal plant waste is more radioactive than nuclear waste, and much of it enters the environment. 

Nuclear will be absolutely needed for base load demands. Other renewables simply cannot meet that same baseload demand. 

I have hope that AI power demands will help make nuclear more affordable. I think renewables are surging now because of all the investment, but once they saturate their niche, and all the best spots are taken, nuclear will become more politically viable. 

So, to your point, current nuclear, as it's done now, is not as cost effective as other sources like coal, but it has the lowest environmental impact, Is the safest, has the most reliable baseload, and is the only power source capable of meeting humanity's power needs in the long run.

Still thats the type of grandiose, civilizational level expenses we should be considering.  I'd pay a bunch more taxes if that form of ambition was what we were doing.  Its also the sort of investment in industry that can actually convince conservatives to actually do something, too.  One of the last bi-partisan topics remaining.  

Similarly every south facing roof in the northern hemisphere should be solared.  The price curve may be favourable for this in a few years.  That may mean diffuse adoption of this directly where the power is needed.  Battery backup is coming too.

People laugh at me, but theres tons of options to clean up the CO2 in particular, while renovating the oil industry.  A green heat source, such as solar furnace, renewables derived electrical elements, or high temperature low pressure reactors can obsolete oil extraction and renovate oil refining.

You pipe sea water in.  You take your heat source.   You then desalinate, and crack carbonic acid out of the sea water.  You can then synthesize a host of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, ammonia, etc.  Refine for combustible fuels.  Then if you burn gasoline in a car or kerosene in a plane, its 1:1 carbon neutral, as you derived all of that CO2 from the carbon cycle to begin with.  Or, somehow find how to incentivize carbon harvesting, separate it from the mix and crush down to graphene or something we need anyway.

$$$$$.  We need tons of it to do these things.  We have it, its locked into retirement savings of an aging population.  Its hoarded by billionaries trying to play oligarchy.  It's squandered on missile cruisers.  Its a shame how fucked our value systems are because we could solve practically everything with technology we now already understand.",0

We've already survived billions of years.

Of course on the flip side that unbroken chain has likely millions of broken chains attached to it that never survived long term. We certainly don't have a garuntee of surviving another billion years. 

But long term survival usually goes to generalists and we are some of, if not the best generalist species on the planet.

"There's a political system called corporatism that does have corporations controlling policy but it's actually a bit more interesting than it appears just from the name. It's actually more similar to stakeholder capitalism than to the current system

The idea is basically that interest groups (corporations) should be directly involved in policy with the state existing more as a mediating force between different interest groups. The thing that makes this interesting is that all people would belong to their various interest groups as well and theoretically this gives everyone a seat at the table whether they are large corporations or towns, neighborhoods, churches, or any other social structure who's members have interests of their own. You can think of these interest groups as being like unions.

This is different from liberal democracy because under a liberal democracy these interest groups are not able to sit at the same table. The voters are expressing their interests by way of voting, the corporations are expressing their interests by paying politicians before anyone gets to vote.  This has obviously resulted in an unbalanced system where the only things the voters are able to vote about are the scraps that lobbyists didn't care enough about to pay for. Theoretically if people were treated like interest groups instead of like voting bases and interest groups were directly involved in government, then that would mean everyone is actually playing the same game for once. The different interest groups that would be affected by something would send representatives to negotiate for their groups interests while the state mediated and moderated with the aim of making sure all interests are fairly considered.

The ideas behind corporatism do have issues, some strains more than others, but historically these types of structures  have been common and pretty successful. Scandinavian countries are often cited as a modern example of a type of corporatist system. It is an interesting idea, and I think at least worthy of discussion. If properly implemented, it seems that it may be a better way to run a society that aims to represent the will be the people and not just the will of those with huge amounts of money.

"Crisis averted, glad I haven't bought any kirkland brand eggs.

The FDA has escalated a recall of Kirkland Signature organic, pasture-raised 24-count eggs sold at Costco to the highest Class I alert level due to potential salmonella contamination. This classification indicates a ""reasonable probability"" that consuming the eggs could result in ""serious adverse health consequences or death."" The recall was first announced in late November 2024 and updated in December after further concerns emerged.

### Key Details of the Recall:
- **Brand and Product**: Kirkland Signature Organic Pasture-Raised 24-Count Eggs.
- **Affected Locations**: Distributed to approximately 25 Costco stores in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
- **Identification**: The recalled eggs are packaged in plastic cartons with:
  - **UPC Code**: 9661910680
  - **Julian Code**: 327
  - **Plant Number**: P1363
  - **Use-By Date**: January 5, 2025
- **Volume**: About 10,800 cartons were distributed.

### Reason for Recall:
The recall was initiated by Handsome Brook Farms after discovering that eggs from an environment testing positive for salmonella were inadvertently packaged for retail distribution. The company has since implemented additional supply chain controls and retraining to prevent future issues.

### Health Risks:
Salmonella can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. While most healthy individuals recover within a week, severe cases can lead to hospitalization or death, particularly in vulnerable populations like children under five, adults over 65, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems.

### Consumer Guidance:
- Stop consuming the affected eggs immediately.
- Return them to Costco for a full refund or dispose of them safely.
- Monitor for symptoms if the eggs were consumed and seek medical attention if necessary.

This recall highlights ongoing concerns about food safety and the importance of vigilance in handling and monitoring food products.",1

"Let's keep it simple. 

In Marxist Economics, commerce, debt, wages, competition, profit, the state, prices and currency don't just evaporate -- they still exist. It's just that instead of most large companies being run by a board of directors accountable only to share-holders, they'd be run by the workers themselves using some form of democracy -- either direct (everybody votes) or representative (workers elect a governing board from the pool of workers). 

Ostensibly such a company would in fact be more efficient and better for its community. Workers would not vote to off-shore their own company for higher profits, nor would they evade taxes. Workers would vote to give themselves better wages across the board, instead of giving the few elected board members exorbitant salaries several times higher than other workers -- excess profit can be reinvested into the company or saved as a relief fund so that workes still get paid in leaner times (whereas in private companies, most of that money goes to the board and they simply lay people off when profits take a downturn). Finally, they might actually produce better, safer and more effective products their communities need since the goal would be sustain the company and pay good (but not oligarchic) wages rather than maximize profits. 

This doesn't really take a violent revolution to achieve; such models exist in our current society in some form or another (in Germany, unions have representation on boards of directors, there are worker-owned companies like WinCo). Incremental legislation to make it easier to unionize and democratize workplaces would achieve this over time. The weakness of this system is the same one you have with any democracy: elected persons become targets for corruption, the voting class becomes targets for disinformation. 

How could this work in practice? People always assume we wouldn't have things like smart phones or video games under socialist frameworks, but those things would probably actually be better. Imagine a group of tech entrepreneurs filed a charter to form a public corporation for the express purpose of building a smart phone for the public good. They could raise public money to buy capital and hire workers with the subject matter expertise. Since maximizing profit is not a goal, they can pay everyone well. Additionally, since the goal is to just create a great phone (rather than sell a product and maximize profits by laundering your data) it could also be cheaper, less invasive privacy-wise and more reliable. A society driven by WORKERS (rather than capitalists) would create goods the public actually needs.",1

There is scope to put grazing and poultry underneath solar farms, he said, and thinks some could be used “to boost some areas of peatland”.

“I don’t think it’s been done yet – but there is the potential to put solar farms on degraded lowland peat, say in the fens, for example. Essentially putting them on stilts and rewetting lowland peat underneath and starting to get the peat growing again, that would be really exciting.”

They assume that's the case on Earth because on Venus the at the bottom hot atmosphere warms the surface, via conduction. On Earth the air is **colder** than the surface and here the warmer surface warms the above air, also via conduction. The air cools the surface!

Then the next thing: They calculate... why no experiment that shows that these few CO2 molecules make the air even hotter - 3 or 4 of 10.000 molecules are supposed to additionally warm (thermalization) the already at the surface warmed air?

"New tech is here. Tech that could have serious impacts on the stability of the magnetic field cycles. 

NASAs been watching a mysterious dent in the field and now there's two ..and they're growing. SAA **South Atlantic Anomaly.** 

The AI response on google will report that the SAA pose no threat to life on Earth.. only satellites in the upper atmosphere, but funny thing about the freshwater lakes nearest those dents.. 

Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela is the lightning capital of thee world. Look up Catatumbo lightning or the everlasting storm..

East African Rift Valley is the second, home to the next most lightning prone lakes in the world. 

The Sun's also got a magnetic field which can also affect lightning on Earth. When the solar magnetic field is pointing towards the Sun, it can increase lightning rates by an average of 40–60% but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. When the Sun's magnetic field is pointing away, we're more vulnerable to high-energy particles which may impact the charging processes and electric current flow in thunderstorms. 

If the field is getting holes punched in it by new tech, what's getting in and what's it doing to the stability of field overall ? How much impact does this have on climate and weather ? Bees use the mag field to navigate.. we need those, I think. Whales and birds use it too. Somethings been messing with them lately. 

If the field destabilizes dramatically and the sun is working against us ? It's end times shit.. Land slip. Extinction level event. Waves. Fucking Waves. Cataclysmic storms with lightning that can carve out canyons, volcanos popping off. Biotic crisis.

If it's gone entirely, we ..are ..Mars.",0

Also, you’d probably not be the most environmentally friendly farm anyway, which are typically the big factory farms. 

I’m also not sure if anyone has done a per liter of milk calculation of environmental friendliness since cows produce a LOT of milk, sheep, much less so.

The 'housing crisis' is mostly a \*transportation\* issue - specifically we have small 'islands' of high-value economic activity (hub cities) that have either intentionally (in service of urbanisim/environmentalisim/politics) or through lack of investment made it too difficult to car-commute 'in' from the surrounding area.

There is no 'housing crisis' in middle-of-nowhere rust-belt factory towns, that's where the idiots bitching about 'vacant housing' get their stats from... Yeah, there's vacant housing in Lordstown OH, because there is no reason to live in Lordstown....

There's also largely no housing crisis in rural America - which has a reason for some people to be there, but not a reason to pack more-and-more people into an ever smaller space.

If you want to slow house-price appreciation (prices coming down would be very, very bad - see 2008), you need to break down the 'traffic walls' around the hub cities, and make reasonable-distance commuting viable again such that the commutable-area is larger &amp; people can spread out without accruing a 2hr+ commute...

The percentage and the amount of the natural gas used in electricity generation of Germany rose up steadily from early millennium to 2010, minus the year 2009 regarding the amount as the overall electricity production has fallen significantly for that year. From early to mid 2010s, they've ramped up the use of coal instead of that as it was cheaper. Yet, by 2015, the share and the amount of natural gas began rose again, while the share of coal started to fall. Then, from 2019, you had the sharp decline in energy demand so surely percentages look better - up until the demand rises again.

In this experiment, a pendulum is made with a string and a make-shift rocket filled with fuel. The pendulum starts still, having settled at the center point due to the force of gravity.  

The experimenter then uses a laser to ignite the fuel.  

Once this is done, you can see horizontal motion as the fuel ignites. This motion begins as soon as propellants are released from the rocket, and is observed as the pendulum making small oscillations as the propulsion builds in force to combat the gravity previously holding it still.  

As the flux of the propellant leaving the rocket increases to levels necessary to overcome the gravity holding the rocket down, you'll observe the rocket travels.",0

"The key problem here is that Christianity requires salvation through faith, which will fundamentally encourage its followers into holding imperialist mentalities. 

If you belief the only way to be rewarded in the afterlife is simply through believing in the religion (which isn't unique to Christianity, but is far less common then most people might believe,) then the necessary follow-through is that the moral thing is to convince as many outsiders into joining the faith as possible. Historically this has been through invasion and conquest, but even without that, it's necessarily going to encourage in-group thinking and racism towards anyone who doesn't fall in line with the current hegemony. 

This isn't an explicit part of the religion's scripture, but it is just kind of a fundamental consequence as to how the faith is structured.",1

"You’re still describing outcomes, not origins.  
Yes, the atmosphere exhibits kinetic energy and temperature gradients under gravity. But *what drives* that motion?

This work shows that **R**, the gas constant, isn’t just an empirical bridge between pressure, volume, and temperature — it *emerges* from fundamental electromagnetic structure. It’s not arbitrary.  It’s constructed from field constants.

I’ve extended this by linking it to the average temperature at **1 bar** to Earth or Venus — using a simplified expression: ( (Ne\^2\*Uo\*h/(4\*pi\*3600\^2\*σ)\^.25

Here, **Ne** represents the number of electrons in a mole of air. While the dimensional analysis isn’t fully resolved yet, the numerical result nails it — and the geometric symmetry holds for Venus as well. That’s not coincidence.

This reveals that the atmosphere isn’t merely kinetic — it’s **electro-dynamic**. Charged particles, field interactions, and dielectric responses govern energy distribution. Temperature isn’t the origin — it’s the *result* of molecular-scale charge agitation and field structuring.

This doesn’t ""take away"" from thermodynamics — it **reveals what underpins it**.",1
"One thing we should consider in a map like this is that these countries have widely different populations, and as a result the economies of scale for nuclear reactors are wildly different. 


For example, Ireland's grid can probably sustain roughly one nuclear plant. This would require setting up a nuclear board and training pipeline for just this one plant which is going to make it incredibly cost inefficient compared to large countries.


Therefore, despite being pro nuclear energy in general, I would respond to “How much of your country’s energy consumption should be generated by nuclear power plants in your country?” with ""not at all""

"This is a much more complex topic than I'm going to treat it for this. 

First, relative to its size Portugal was extremely wealthy but it's a small nation even by euro standards. 

2 Spain hyperinflated their currency because they brought in so much gold from the new world thst they devalued gold in Spain. Then they suffered 400 years of political instability with constant conflict over control and contsnt governmental changes and reforms. They were also late to industrilization.

3. The reason people claim colonization is primarily based on the argument that countries like the uk and France used the wealth generated by colonialism to fund industrialization. To some extent this is true. However there are also nations like Germany who had few colonies and Russia who had no colonies that also heavily industrialized.  Russia was slow to do so and mostly was industrialized through Stalin and at great cost in people.  Germany on the other hand did actually industrialize relatively early. So much so thst they tried to compete with the uk for a navy. Before they couldn't because they were so heavily out numbered but the dawn of dreadnoughts meant they didn't have to out produce the uk they could instead attempt to match them 1:1 in production. Obviously they failed but the high seas fleet was still massive and for a country that have very few colonies, some thet were land locked and difficult to access it is still impressive.

Certainly places like the uk had an advantage in industrialization not only through preestablished wealth but in access to resources actively being extracted thst could be brought to the uk and manufactured into products. 

Ultimately after being decimated by two world wars most of Europe had effectively cashed in their colonial holdings to survive. While I have no doubt that there is still great generational wealth that dates back to colonialism economicly Europe is long divided from their colonial gains, much was used to start industrialization sure, but most of it went to surviving the world wars. France and the uk for example relied heavily on them for resources and personel, both lacked the political willpower and then military to keep their colonies after the war ended. Germany on the otherhand lost its colonies after wwi,  Russia only ever had its she's and oblaststo exploit, China is similar to Russia but later and more agrarian to start, and the US is it's own study. The us only briefly held colonies taken from Spain, i would argue they were too small and held for too short of a time to actually play a major role in American industrialization. However I am certain that they did play a roll at least in providing some resources. America like Russia has vast resources and is large but unlike any other nation listed has the benefit of being isolated from danger. That's likely the key to American industrialization in that it was never threatened or bombed. 


I agree colonialism is not why Europe is wealthy today however it certainly did give some nations an advantage. The world wars acted as an equalizer. Entire generations were killed, industry was annihilated. That being said some of the wealthiest nations in Europe did get their through their colonies ( France, uk) some like Germany did not ( but post world war two the west invested heavily in rebuilding Germany)  Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Belgium are successful enough today but their colonial holdings are not a major contributing factor imo. Spain because of instability, Belgium because the wealth went to a single family not the nation, Portugal due to its size and it's political policies, itsly because they were late to colonizing and because they were unstable. Then you have nations like the Baltic, balkens, the Nordic countries, the Slavic countries, and turkey. None of them had colonies and there's a wide spread of economic success. The Nordic countries are fairly successful Finland, Norway. And Denmark were all invaded during wwii, but they recovered. Greece is certainly not a strong economy even today but I would argue that is tied heavily to their political intibility in the early 20th century. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Chezk/Slovak, Poland and all of former yugo, have had ethnic turmoil,invasions, nations like Austria Hungary and thr soviet union control some of them and then dissolve. While none of those nations have had an easy go of it they also weren't colonial powers. In their case again the wealth disparity is tied heavily to the instsbility and turmoil in their nations. Still several of them are doing well and are functioning first world countries. 

Tldr: Like I mentioned above I'm dumbing down an incredibly complex topic, people have written books about single nations I've listed and even single time spans for these nations. Colonialism helped a lot, but there are lots of points where colonial wealth could have been or was reset. Politics and wars are more influential. There are economicly powerful nations that never had colonies, but every nation exploited someone to get where they are now. Some just got lucky and didn't have the internal issues that others did, some were part of major wars, and some were protected by geographical barriers. Ultimately exploited wealth is only as useful as you have competent and stable leaders to make use of it.",1
"You're absolutely right in the sense of consumption. Where it becomes a little more tricky is when a small number of wealthy and resource rich countries decide to virtue signal and create the unintended effect of making the world worse off in terms of production decisions. 

Here's an example. In Canada, there is huge opposition to any new development of fossil fuels, for the reasons you laid out above, but Canada has a well regulated, clean (relative to this dirty industry), industry, that also tends to flow more into the hands of it's people than other areas, and supports a relatively stable democracy. Nigeria on the other hand produces lots of oil, with a terribly regulated industry, where the industry tends to further impoverish its people (see the resource curse), has unimaginable environmental consequences, and the money flows into the hands of very few, eroding democratic institutions. Other major producers are also countries with not great records of regulation, environment and human rights. Also, most of those places are not having the same conversations about voluntarily constraining their industries 

Given that global demand is a constant, it's not much effected by decisions about Canada producing more or less, so it means that Canada producing less than it might otherwise, has the effect of causing more production to shift to places like Nigeria. 

So, as long as each of us still consumes some oil and oil products, it will be produced somewhere. Our choices decide the environmental and social impacts of that same production. Let's say you were buying a new pair of shoes with soles made from oil. Where would you prefer that oil to be produced and refined, a western country like US, Canada or Norway, or somewhere like Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, etc?",1

But this technology is limited it is not capable of changing direction of low and high pressure fronts which drive winds. These are the forces which drive the small scale weather phenomenon like storms and hurricanes(along with the rotation of the earth, which hemisphere these systems are taking place in and so much more). I would start by trying to wrap your mind around the energy moving in these systems in terms that we can easily understand. Look up how much energy is being expended per hour in a category 1,2,3,4 and 5 hurricane per hour in Hiroshima Atomic bombs.(It’s A lot) and then think about how these systems are subject to the whims of weather systems on a much higher magnitude of energy output. It quickly becomes clear that the energy required to modify these systems is much higher than the global energy output of the human race per year.",1

Battery storage is at least one, if not two orders of magnitude too expensive to solve the problem and so is not credibly a solution beyond ""it doesn't exist yet, but if this was developed, if it worked, if it could be produced at scale at \~10% of the known costs then it might possibly be a solution in a few decades"".

Which is a really roundabout way of saying ""let's stay on fossil fuels for the next several decades and hope something gets invented that might create a possibility of working and we might think about talking about deploying it in \~2045"" rather than a thoroughly boring civil engineering programme that could start now and be up and running in a decade; 2035.

Throwing every problem of the world at the feet of the US and calling them responsible for the problem is nonsense.  Their own governments need to take responsibility and lead their country to success.  The US government cannot overcome the direction these governments chose to take their country, even if they wanted to.  

At some point in time, you have to let these people and government have self determination and experience the outcomes of those decisions.

"Frankly, you seem to be misinformed about economics. There is no ""Republican economics"" and ""Democrat Economics"". Neither is ""Trickle down economics"" an actual economics term, it's just a saying used in politics.

You are right that economists disagree on many things. However, you don't need to have consensus on everything for science. In fact, if you had that, scientific discussion would be stale and progress couldn't be made. This is especially true in social sciences. Few findings and theories in psychology and sociology are universally agreed upon. Economics is more of a ""hard science"" than both of these, features more serious empirical work that generally tries to establish causation rather than correlation.

"The logic here breaks down pretty quickly. If the cost of living were truly about optional luxuries, then cutting back should solve the problem. But most families are not stressed because they are trying to keep up with neighbors. They are stressed because rent, healthcare, childcare, and education have all become unaffordable on median incomes. You can’t budget your way out of structural costs. Living “less expensively” doesn’t help when even basic shelter eats up half your paycheck.

Blaming women for this pressure also ignores reality. Market data consistently show that both partners in most households contribute financially because they have to, not because one of them insists on designer furniture or expensive brunches. In fact, many women report feeling guilt or burnout because they work full time and still carry most of the domestic load. That is not a lifestyle upgrade. That is survival under a system that demands two incomes while still expecting one partner to do the caregiving.

Social pressure exists, yes, but it is shaped by culture, advertising, and economic precarity, not by women whispering in their partners’ ears to buy a nicer car. Suggesting that women are the main source of this pressure shifts blame away from real causes and onto individuals, often in ways that echo gender stereotypes that are older than the average Senator. The pressure to perform success affects everyone, and it is worth questioning who profits from a system that keeps everyone feeling like they are falling behind.",1

"Berry Gordy was born in Detroit in 1929 to a working-class family that included seven brothers and sisters. After military service during the Korean conflict, he opened a record store in his hometown that specialized in his musical preference - jazz. Gordy quickly found that his customers preferred the driving beat of rhythm and blues to the subtle nuances of jazz. This necessitated a change in his product mix. It was at this juncture that he encountered a record wholesaler known as the ""Mad Russian"" - a man, Gordy later wrote, who was the first Jewish person he had knowingly met. To boost sales, this unnamed immigrant provided Gordy with early R &amp; B releases, thus giving him an advantage over his competition. Unfortunately, the shop's debt could not be overcome, even with the Mad Russian's assistance, and Gordy was forced to close his store. To earn a living, Gordy took a job on an auto-assembly line. In his spare time, he began writing songs for local rhythm-and-blues artists with a partner named Roquel Billy Davis. As the duo's reputation grew they met with the Jewish owners of ""black and tan"" clubs, showbars where blacks and whites mingled and enjoyed music. Unwittingly, these Jewish-owned clubs became incubators where the seeds of the Motown sound took root.",0

"Assumptions: 
1. marriage/ long-term relationships generate more children
-This is not true. Women tend to have more children when lacking security and personal opportunity. Lower birth rates are found in the most prosperous societies. This trend is trackable back several hundred years. 

2. Societies must collapse if the population shrinks. 
- Our current model of growth capitalism cannot survive fewer people.  However, the current economic model is going hit a number of resource limits. 300 years is a good run. However, it is just the current model. There are many ways to structure the world.  Democracy is 3000 years old and seems to keep popping back up. Probably going to get in the way of the pretty controlling birth rate improvement plans. 

There’s a number of unknowns coming.  
1. Automation -Humans may have a lot leas to do and fewer opportunities, so more social lives, more children…maybe. 
2. Environmental collapse -20 years out, the oceans are going to be pretty toxic to the current sea-life. Unfortunately, this will simply destroy the food chain. A good portion of the current coast will be under water. Most of the human population lives near the ocean and rely on it. So breeding more is may be impossible as food supply constricts.

"&gt;I apologize for misrepresenting what you said

No worries

&gt;If you are comfortable sharing, could you tell me some mechanisms you have used to cope with your diagnosis?

I'm still in the process, but it boils down to identifying what I'm trying to achieve, i.e. what are my goals and what limitations are put in place that make reaching that goal difficult?

For me personally, it makes reaching goals more difficult in general. It made concentrating at work (developer) harder, it made losing weight harder, it made studying harder, etc. I have to build new habits.

For me, I'm not really prevented from reaching specific goals, but rather the road is harder and I need to find ways to deal with that. At work for example, I've claimed a specific desk that limits the amount of distractions, I use headphones, I take medication to help me concentrate.

In your case, your illness limits your activities. Ask yourself what your goal is with those activities. Do you enjoy going out? 

You mentioned alcohol too, what do you like about it? Very few people like alcohol just for the alcohol itself. Do you simply enjoy the social settings? Does not being able to drink alcohol really prevent you from doing that? People already do that without drinking alcohol.

Yeah it's a gut punch, but it's about seeing what you still have and how to compensate for what you lost.

You'll get there eventually, but it's gonna take time, effort and the will to put in that effort.

&gt;You're right about the last part too. Perhaps I just feel more helpless than I usually do with my current situation. I have trouble viewing society from the perspective of anything other than suffering lately, so I'm probably losing a lot of important context from that alone.

"That is a fair point!  This research only describes a different process than subduction, despite the similarities.  In subduction, one tectonic plate slides under another plate boundary.  What the Sierra Nevada study shows is ""*lithospheric foundering*"" happens when the dense bottom portion of the continental lithosphere (solid outer layer of the Earth) detaches and sinks into the mantle (hot rock) under the same continent.

While both processes involve rock sinking into the mantle, subduction happens at plate boundaries between ***different plates***, while lithospheric foundering happens within a **single** continental plate.  This foundering process helps explain how continents become less dense over time, as the heavier materials sink away, leaving lighter crust behind.

The Sierra Nevada research is only a case study because it reveals this process at different stages across the mountain range, which gives people a rare timeline view of continental evolution that usually takes millions of years to unfold.",1

"All ancient specimens used in the study are from previous studies. There are no new specimens. All dating estimates use either modern specimens or a small number of ancient specimens that had already been published in previous studies. Uniparental (Y-DNA and mtDNA) haplogroups of ancient specimens and of modern samples with date estimates of the first occurrence of each haplogroup can be seen at FTDNA and YFull. None are Asian except more recent back migrations. They are all under 16,000 years old. That is the date of expansion within the Americas. The vast majority of Native American groups in North America and South America, minus Inuit and Koryaks descend, from just two founding males which have Y-DNA haplogroups Q-M3 and Q-Z780. The vast majority of mtDNA haplogroups are A2,B2, subclades of C1, and D1. So there are basically 2 founding males and 4 founding females for the majority of Native Americans.

These haplogroups were left along the path because it was a population expansion and not a direct migration. The ancestors of these haplogroups have descendants in Asia providing evidence that Native Americans are originally from Asia. Siberia in particular.

All of this was already known before this study. The study simply added modern samples, not ancient samples.

"While i agree with you that there is a relationship that benefits both sides that would be really hurt if a war was started (food for china, and manufacturing resources to America), I think you are downplaying the amount of critical minerals China has a monopoly over and the amount of time it would take to build up a new supply chain in America or elsewhere. I would also argue that it's easier for China to find a trading partner that can supply food vs America finding a trading partner that has similar access to critical resources. It may be difficult for China to replace oil and gas imports but I have a ""hunch"" that Russia may be able to help China out in that situation. 

  
I also think you are pointing out the strengths of a globalist free trading system. Where war becomes so difficult since so many people rely on one another that it creates additional barriers to waging war because everyone is connected through global trade. Keeping these trading relationships open, as long as they are generally fair, plays a large role at minimizing the chances of a full out war. If a full out economic decoupling occurs then it's a much more dangerous situation since China needs food (and gas/oil to an extent) to survive, so it will potentially start being more aggressive and it has a manufacturing capacity to be formidable. It's also important to project soft power that builds alliances with America instead of China (China has a history of being a little more aggressive and exploitative). It's a little concerning that China is starting to become more ""globalist"" and trying to fill the gap that the US created by pulling out of it's global obligations (WHO, USAID, and others). China is also the world leader in clean energy now, which is a priority for a lot of countries, so China has even more leverage and can maybe get more allies, or at least friendlier countries.

That is all absolutely fine and reasonable, if you want the country to have almost no population growth. If you want population growth to be five times above the historical level, you need to have a seriously pro-development mindset otherwise you are just voting for housing to be ridiculously expensive or inaccessible.

"So, if I understand this correctly a system of renewables was installed and then cannot be controlled centrally by the people who are tasked with maintaining the grid?????

I believe from what the article contains is that the real issue lies with the inability to disable the contribution rooftop and low-cost Chinese PV cells.  Rooftop solar, which according to google has a maximum capacity of 81.8 GW with an aim of getting to 215 by 2030, is centrally uncontrollable which is a major issue which is just going to get worse with more capacity without some sort of control intervention?  As far as the Chinese PV's maybe cheapest does not always mean best?

"Portugal was the first country to move away from austerity measures, doing the opposite in a progressive and sustainable way, because austerity tanked our economy. Government kept tight budgets to stay under EU budget rules, but started to make some public investments in some sectors, while taking back some control in sectors that were privatised, even taking back public transportation, or TAP airlines. They used TAP to promote tourism, offering a stay on Portugal to passengers passing by, and that was a success when EU started to recover and tourism grew. Also allowed immigration, mainly from Portuguese former colonies, that were key in providing workers to booming agricultural production, mainly for export in some sectors.",1

50 years ago, we already had solar. We already had wind. Already had hydroelectric. Already had nuclear.

And 50 years ago, the world's population was less than half of what it is now.

Technology is driven by a small handful of people, compared to the overall population. Like 1-5%. If we didn’t use fossil fuels for everything under the sun, but instead had only used them judiciously, and pointed our energies at more tech research, instead of Superbowls and Nascar races and stockpiling explosives that could kill us all...we'd be much further advanced than we are now. 

We could've easily had solar/wind for the whole world already, if big oil wasn't trying to kill the research/gov't funding at every step for decades. And we probably would've already cracked fusion, by now.

They are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuel and requires immediate action. We do not agree.”2 Those who have signed the letter represent the overwhelming majority of climate change scientists in the United States, of whom there are about 60. McMichael and Haines quote the 1995 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely believed to “prove” that climate change induced by humans has occurred.3 The original draft document did not say this. What happened was that the policymakers’ summary (which became the “take home message” for politicians) altered the conclusions of the scientists. This led Dr Frederick Seitz, former head of the United States National Academy of Sciences, to write, “In more than sixty years as a member of the American scientific community ... I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.”4

Policymaking should be guided by proved fact, not speculation. 

Most members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believe that current climate models do not accurately portray the atmosphere-ocean system. Measurements made by means of satellites show no global warming but a cooling of 0.13°C between 1979 and 1994.5 Furthermore, since the theory of global warming assumes maximum warming at the poles, why have average temperatures in the Arctic dropped by 0.88°C over the past 50 years?5",1

Take for instance the issue of same sex marriage. Many states—13 in fact—still have dormant bans on same sex marriage; dormant in part thanks to Obergerfell.

It allows same sex marriages performed within the US to be recognized across the US, and prevents religious institutions that do not practice same sex marriage from being forced to perform those marriages. The RFMA is a good example of a law that addresses needs for everyone: R’s get to keep their religious freedoms and the D’s get same sex marriages protected—or rather a little more protected in case the failsafe Obergerfell is struck down.

"Lets suppose, for the sake of argument, that a few more people died and went hungry during the industrial revolution... but in order to focus on sustainable / clean technology, which would have mostly eliminated current climate crisis concerns of today.

Do you make that trade today? Of course you do, right?

You are thinking short term in your current thinking. 

I don't know how to make you care about things beyond your lifetime, and that is perhaps irreconcilable - but the fact that you would happily do it retroactively / in hindsight should give you pause.   
  
Putting the earth's finite resources towards homeless junkies who, quite frankly, are basically guaranteed to produce little value is taking those resources away from longer term investments with multiplicative value.

Yes, space exploration seems like a frustratingly hard technology problem... but the idea that the 'only' value from it is space colonization hundreds of years beyond your lifetime is kind of wrong. There's exploration, asteroid detection, and mining of rare earth / fission materials that all have much nearer term applicability.",1

These waves can be harmful but only when in close proxy to a high out put transmitter.   A GMRS walkie talkie that is only 5 watts  can transmit  can reach out a few miles.  It goes a lot farther then that but the signal is no longer useable. A wifi router can't even hit 1/4 mile.

Australia is very close to the best place in the worl d for mining and storage.

We should be capturing all parts of the value, instead we do the dumbest/easiest bit (mining) and other countries capture all the value.

With our mines/storage geology, we could be world leaders in nuclear. WE should be the ones driving down the costs and capturing the value , instead we're not smart enough to think long term and strategically (like the Chinese did with EV's, and are now doing with nuclear). In 10-30 years when nuclear is matured we'll be importing the tech instead of leading/driving it. We would generate so much high tech, high value knowledge in doing this - force whoever's tech we buy (French, US, China) to do tech transfer - build capability and knowledge here.

It's not really about accuracy, its about probability. The probability calculations work with distinct buckets.

Once we have abstracted it to distinct buckets it becomes a probability calculation the same as picking colored balls from a bag.

If we have a set of climate change predictions that have a best and a worst case and where we can make a judgement as to which of these is correct, the problem will translate directly into Baysian statistics.

We do not need to consider the reasons how things are working to apply the statistics. We have constructed an abstract model above the level of reasons for sea level rise or number of extinctions, or the negative or positive inter-relationships between them.",0

If he wins, force Congress to introduce an amendment to extend his term, and gave the Supreme Court suspend transition to the legal successor until the process is done, which will take at least 2 years. 

If he loses, refuse to leave, and tell Pete Hegseth to stand down and for the first time in American History, the US Military will be running the country for a South American style dictator, under Marshall law for a person who is simply an American citizen.. 

There will be no law in the streets.. law enforcement and citizens will be at war with real lethal force.

The treasury will be devastated.

The value of the dollar will go the way of the peso.. 

And our nuclear stockpiles will be unattended as Elon will have fired them all.. 

The Russian Coup will be complete..

And all the young white men thot thought this was liberation day from diversity equity and inclusion will be in bread lines, broke, eating tainted and poison meat sold off carts in the streets, the children will be dirty and begging and they will be forgotten, as the new Dictator and his friends play golf ..

"I can't read the full article but, if it follows the pattern of these things, it's probably misleading propaganda. 


Fact 1. The ""costs"" of wind curtailment are usually primarily made up of the cost of gas burned in gas plants in England.


Why are they burning gas in English gas plants when the wind is blowing?


 Fact 2. Because the Tories banned building wind turbines there, even though they were the cheapest source of energy. 


Somehow this utterly obvious political failure is the fault of wind turbines?


 Now, if you want to ignore the elephant in the room, you can probably improve the current situation by


 a) building more transmission
 b) building more batteries
 c) introducing price cuts to encourage electricity use near wind turbines and when the wind is blowing


 but not building cheap generation in England for years is the actual problem is squarely the fault of right wing politicians and the people who voted for them.",0

&gt;5 trillion watts of heat energy into space and onto radiators every hour

You don't need to say per hour, it's just 5 terawatts. (Or 5 terawatt-hours per hour, if you want to be redundant.)

&gt;I can't see how it wouldn't.

Not with that attitude !  
  
The op asked for maximum possible, which is constrained only by physics. All other considerations may be assumed as secondary.

Your arguments from incredulity make it sound like you're imagining burning coal to power a mechanical elevator. I think you've grossly underestimated the limits of physics where mature molecular manufacturing, energy harvesting from space, orbital megastructures etc are concerned.  
  
An orbital ring around the earth with a million evacuated tethers carrying giant ballistic pressure vessels full hot of coolant, (or even solid masses which act as their own radiators once in space) at hypersonic speeds isn't precluded by physics. Regenerative deceleration at both ends can reclaim most of the kinetic energy inductively. Performance coefficients of 3 or 4 to 1 are possible even with current heat pump methods, and carnot efficiency limits the theoretical maximum to about 14 to 1.

I don't think it's outlandish to assume super advanced future technology might improve on our shitty 'tubes full of freon' type designs. Even if it didn't by much , harvesting the equvalent of 25% or 50% of the amount energy you want to remove isn't impossible in the context of building orbital rings etc.

Get your nanotech swarm to compile the asteroid belt into a cloud of photovoltaics around the sun and beam the energy back to earth orbit with masers or whatever.

Now I quite agree it isn't worth doing that just to fit a few extra people on earth. With those capabilities the sensible thing to do is leave the whole of the earth as a nature preserve and have everyone live on the giant orbital ring or peripheral cylinder habitats. Or go the whole hog and dissassemble mercury and venus to put a ring round the sun,  but that wouldn't answer the OP's question.",1

You're right that there are very few new private monopolies created legally today. AFAIK only the US uses that regulated private industry approach for energy, and there aren't many new energy utilities in the US.

Switch to healthcare tied to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) otherwise known colloquially as Obamacare. It strengthens that sysytem and force private healthcare to be more afforadable. Buy generic brands for your prescriptions. Also, drives down pharma costs. 

For any other products or services tied to the hard right...boycott them! For instance, don't buy on Amazon!!! So many other (and cheaper) alternatives to get your products!!  Its the most effective way to protest!! They CANT tell you what to buy or what services to use!

Do not support other products and services that employ AI either (as much as possible). If you don't need AI to perform a task DONT use it! 

Lets hope a competitor to Meta/FB also emerges. As soon as a viable one does lets all switch over! Enough is enough!

In addition, and as always call your local representatives and give them a piece of your mind! They actually listen to emails and phone calls. Takes (again) 5 minutes!!

Your position is that of the gambler, that if I keep betting on 13 black at the roulette table, eventually the number will be hit and all our problems will be solved. It is unethical to gamble with both the lives of billions and the survival of countless species that make up our complex ecosystems on that gamble paying off. It is also entirely possible that future technologies are only incremental improvements and not a radical easy solution, meaning that they help things by 5% but not drastically, and by not taking steps now, we miss the opportunity to set ourselves up for success in the future.",1

"&gt;Yes but when the President declares there's going to be a rushed and unprecedented parade with aesthetics uncomfortably close to those of unsavory historical regimes that just so happens to land on his birthday, that's self-evidently controversial.

...which is why I said I agreed with the rest of the post.

&gt;The Marine Corps Ball is War Prom, typically held at the unit level and not in public

Not my experience being sandwiched between MCAS Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune.  They ALWAYS had at least 1 parade off-base in the civilian town(s) surrounding the installations we over at Ft Bragg always got roped into providing logistics for, they ALWAYS also had their battalion-level or higher Pass in Review on-post (for those not in the military, this is basically a mini parade where the lower enlisted get to stomp around a parade grounds and suffer for the entertainment of their senior officers and any invited politicians), then the Prom-like actual party at the Mess, then we soldiers also had to provide logistical and LE support to go police up all the now-shitfaced Marines in their dress uniforms fucking up in town.  West Coast might be different but they sure as hell did a lot of parading over there for the Marine Corps Birthday.

Edit:  MCB parties seem huge to me, even on small installations, since I was Army and our normal celebration for the Army birthday is extra hours in the duty day and maybe a stale sheet cake in the DFAC you can take a single 1""x1"" square of.  Not a lot of fanfare over it but my career also didn't include any of the major milestone years like the 200th or 250th birthdays.",0
"I see where you’re coming from, and I appreciate you sharing your perspective—it’s always valuable to hear a range of thoughts. While I don’t entirely agree with your choice of words, I do understand your point about the competitive nature of events like the Olympics and World Expos.

That said, I think it’s important to also consider the positive aspects these events bring, such as fostering emotional connections and a sense of unity among participants and viewers. These outcomes may not always be tangible, but they can have a profound impact on how societies view themselves and each other.

I believe events like these aren’t inherently good or bad—they’re complex, with both positive and negative facets. Perhaps your focus on the drawbacks is overshadowing the potential benefits of my idea.

"&gt;For example if a global policy were to come into place that effectively doubled the costs of fossil fuels overnight, this would cause immense damage to the global economy and people's standards of living.

This is actually what we need.  We need to dramatically reduce fossil fuel usage in the short and long term.  We have 6 years left before warming is going to exceed 1.5C and 20 years before it hits 2C.  Extinctions are occurring at 1000-10000 times the natural extinction rate.

"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold Tennessee’s ban on access to gender-affirming medical treatments for adolescents after hearing oral arguments on Wednesday, and right-wing activists are celebrating by vowing to completely stamp out America’s transgender community.

Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, became the first trans American to argue before the Supreme Court. Strangio, representing the Department of Justice and the families of several trans youth in Tennessee, argued that the state’s law banning transgender teenagers’ access to hormone treatments and puberty blockers supporting their transition violates the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. The court’s conservative justices — who hold a controlling majority — seemed unconvinced.

The conservative justices seemed hesitant to overrule the state legislature on the matter, determining that they are “not the best situated to address issues like that,” as Chief Justice John Roberts put it. “The Constitution leaves that question to the people’s representatives, rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor,” Roberts said during arguments.

A kilo is 2.2 pounds, so a total of 10 kg is a total of 22lbs, and a difference of 10kg is a difference of 22lbs - because 0kg and 0lbs are the same weight. But 0 degrees C and 0 degrees F are not the same temperature.

Freezing water to boiling is a 100 degrees C difference (0 to 100) and a 180 degrees F difference (32 to 212). Because for a difference, you just multiply by 1.8 (or divide, to go from F to C). You don’t add the 32 degree offset.

"&gt;But on the same hand if you were going to invest A LOT of money into something personally, would you pick something that is more limited in profit or one that is unlimited?

That's only looking at one variable though - ROI. Risk matters. People routinely invest in stuff that has a lower ROI because it has a lower risk associated with it. Would someone invest a lot of money into something personally that limits profits but guarantees low risk? Sure they would! The question becomes fining that risk/reward balance point. If you could build housing that you know will generate dependable income (and likely tie it to inflation somehow) there certainly would be an investor market for that. It's not like everyone is expecting some $10k investment in WizzBang Tech Industries to net them $100m in a decade. Sure, it can happen, but so could winning the lottery. Investing in safe investments over the long run is the better bet. Housing stock could be the same. It's all about balancing your portfolio and building housing for your only investment isn't a great idea either.",1
"Do you think that one won skirmish means won war? Or does won war means achieving your goals?

Yes, latest fight was overwhelmingly won by conservatives. You can't deny that electing Trump alongside getting control of all other parts of government is a win. But to use this won skirmish to win a war would mean to change the public perception to follow the conservative ideas. How much of that actually happened? How much of that is actually likely to happen?

This was a victory that was achieved by bait and switch, not because people became more conservative. It used the problems with economy and perceived too far progressiveness as a point to succeed in elections. But it was at cost of blindsiding their voters. Will that make the voters believe in conservative ideals more? Or rather make them disillusioned with the ideals that are preached by conservatives?

State can try enforcing what they want, but we seen time and time how that ends if you don't get people on side of what you are enforcing. And you now have people who were conservative being openly against what conservative government is doing - less because they think it's wrong and more because it hurts them, but that is exactly an opening to use. You can de-bigotize a bigot if you make them care about others. And nothing makes people closer like facing problems together.

So I think that this is not the sign of a won war, but rather an all-out attempt to overcome a losing war. It could be a turning point if everything goes right, but do you see anything going right? Conservatives managed to pull people to them only to immediately start antagonizing them. Hurting them. Making them feel irrelevant and used. This is not a recipe for winning a war, this is a recipe for losing it spectacularly.",0

"&gt;America doesn't have to be the *worst country in the world* to justify hating it, but having to be 'bad' would be a decent starting benchmark.

And US is quite bad when compared to peers - that is the problem. From citizens point of view there are multiple peer countries where day to day problems that US citizens face are non-existent. There are multipole ones where QoL is better, even if on paper US wins.

&gt;And you may not think it with whatever criticisms you may have of it, but it's a million miles off from being 'bad' by any practical metric, especially by comparison to the majority of other   
countries in the world.

If you compare US to every single country, including dictatorships, failing states and countries in deep economical holes - sure. But what is the efficacy of such comparison? By ""design"" it will always have US closer to top, because there are many countries that are, well, quite shite to live in.

But is ""I am doing better than Joe the Alcoholic who leaves next street"" a good comparison to make? No. It serves only as way to dismiss arising issues. You need to compare with your peers, not general population. That is only way to see where you may have issues and see how others resolve them.

"&gt;Liberalism the reason that liberalism hasn't taken off, it requires the exploitation of the third world to exist in the way that it does.

Leftist cope, which ignores that poorer countries have benefitted from trading with rich countries. Not just in terms of economic statistics, but in real conditions for workers: rates of hunger, childhood mortality, literacy, etc. Trade is usually mutually beneficial, not exploitative.

&gt;The US has invaded more than 80 countries since WW2, mostly to prevent the establishment of popular democratic movements and to make sure that business interests are upheld.

Big exaggeration of the number there. I'm certainly not saying the US has always done the right thing, but generally it has intervened to try and create prosperous democracies. Doing so for both selfish and selfless reasons. We benefit when other countries are free and successful, which is a good system to have. Interventionism is just super hard, and there's really no way to know if you'll save thousands of lives or get stuck in a quagmire.

Like, the Dominican Republic had its dictator assassinated and fell into a civil war. After a few years the US invaded, boots on the ground to stop the fighting and ran an election. US troops left after a year, a democratic government was established, and the country has been stable and improving since. The ideal outcome.

Haiti across the border had almost identical population, GDP, and similar political conditions at the time. It has repeatedly fell into civil wars and had outside intervention, and for many complicated factors, they've never succeeded.

This stems from carbon-intensive materials (carbon fiber, titanium) and energy-heavy manufacturing, typical of high-performance racing yachts.

"I never claimed Africans have more diversity than the rest of the world combined. That’s your insertion—not my argument. I said Africa has the most genetic diversity of any region. That makes rare traits, like extreme intelligence, more likely per capita, not guaranteed. If you’re going to respond, at least address what I actually said.

The genetic diversity point is based on averages, not absolutes. Tishkoff et al. and countless other studies show Sub-Saharan Africans have the highest within-group genetic variation globally. Saying “they can be more different” deliberately downplays a well-established statistical trend. My argument is built on probability, not cherry-picked anecdotes.

The lottery analogy actually proves my point. Africa = individual with the most tickets. That doesn’t mean a guaranteed win—but it does mean the highest odds for extreme traits. That’s the point.

Also, cherry-picking “recorded” height extremes ignores historical context: colonization, poor infrastructure, and a lack of scientific focus on the continent. Who’s even out there documenting rural African cases or even looking? There are countless of variables skewing that data.

Visibility ≠ existence.
Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence.

"I’m a Republican who voted for Trump in 2016, got disillusioned and voted for Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024, but Harris was a bit of a stretch for me. Like it or not, 2016 and 2020 were even-split elections and Democrats should have put forth the most experienced, knowledgeable, and likable candidate possible in 2024, as well as promoted that candidate early on. Biden ran on a campaign of being a transition president but did not step back until it was too late and the Democrats were seemingly stuck with Harris.

I challenge your perspective that Harris “should have been a layup” and Biden was “historically unpopular.” I would also challenge your perspective that Trump was “historically unpopular.” As the last 3 elections have been so close, you could argue that both candidates were “equally popular.”

Harris did not succeed on her own and during Biden’s presidency, she showcased her lack of experience at every turn. She struggled to build more than 5% of primary voters and suspended her own campaign early. On 60 Minutes a few months after winning the election and being named the Border Czar, she revealed that she had not done much international travel before, having only been to Mexico. Seemingly (in the court of public opinion) her “solution” to the border crisis was lambasted as “Do not come.” Her role in the Biden administration was the same as many traditional VP’s: to court a larger voting pool, then sit at the kid’s table while the adults are talking.

Biden’s uniqueness over Trump was that he was the most experienced candidate, having spent over 30 years in the Senate and 8 years in the White House. He did not stand in the way of the Federal Reserve, unlike Trump. He did not court controversy, unlike Trump. He projected an image of a wise old man, unlike Trump.

In my opinion, the political machinations of the rest of the Democratic Party lost the election for them. Imagine if they simply moved on after Trump, without the highly publicized, controversial cases that kept him in the spotlight. Would the Republicans have rallied behind him if it weren’t for him appearing to be attacked by the left? Would they have moved on to other candidates in the primaries? 

The historical precedent is to move on from ex-Presidents and even from popular enemies of the state, which is what Democrats believe Trump to be. Nixon was pardoned without serving time. The entire Confederacy was pardoned after open rebellion. (although Jefferson Davis served 2 years) Why not move on from Trump?

As a secondary point, I do feel that Democrats should have been generally supportive of alternative Republican candidates in the primaries rather than attacking them too. I understand that, by default as their competition, they felt obligated to “compete,” but wouldn’t it be better to bring the country together (Biden’s ethos) rather than sowing further division?",0

"""Prof Geoffrey Hinton, who has admitted regrets about his part in creating the technology, likened its rapid development to the industrial revolution – but warned [the machines could “take control” this time](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/06/threat-artificial-intelligence-more-urgent-climate-change/).

The 77-year-old British computer scientist, who was [awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/08/godfather-ai-nobel-prize-regrets-invention-hinton-smarter/) this year, called for tighter government regulation of AI firms.

Prof Hinton has previously predicted there was a 10 per cent chance AI could lead to [the downfall of humankind](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/27/an-ai-chatbot-told-me-to-murder-my-bullies/) within three decades.

Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if anything had changed his analysis, he said: “Not really. I think 10 to 20 \[years\], if anything. We’ve never had to deal with things more intelligent than ourselves before.

“And how many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing? There are very few examples.”

He said the technology had developed [“much faster” than he expected](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/05/19/artificial-intelligence-developing-too-fast-telegraph/) and could make humans the equivalents of “three-year-olds” and AI “the grown-ups”.

However, Prof Hinton added: “My worry is that the invisible hand is not going to keep us safe. So just leaving it to the profit motive of large companies is not going to be sufficient to make sure they develop it safely.

“The only thing that can force those big companies to do more research on safety is government regulation.""",1

Iceland is heavily depended on the rest of the world for trades. The question remains if they would be able to maintain such living standard without others. I know you are not making a case for some isolationist scenario... but they depend on others (as in, a larger group).  
  
Their small numbers poses health challenges to such an extent that they have an app to help them avoid accidental inbreeding. So dating can be limited. They also have a very low genetical diversity... which is something that is needed for the immune system to keep evolving.

They do have a lot of issues with mental health. Some of it is due to geographical location... but others are simply due to ""everyone knows everyone"". Many struggle with restlessness, loneliness, and disconnection. Not only that, but a varied lifestyle (exploring) is somewhat limited due to culture (as is almost always the case). Can't really be ""too different"".

When it comes to rents and mortgages, many struggle with that too. Costs increase, as they have everywhere else, and there is a low supply on new homes.

"the sphere is a 4D metaphor for an 8D object that exists and houses God. We just can't 'see' it yet.

God lives here on earth. And always has. We just don't have the necessary abilities for our body to perceive it in 4D.

But we know it exists on some level. 

The real 'sphere' isn't a sphere but a geographical area of land called Burnley Wood and Rose hill ward.

Here's the geo data..

Everyone inside this area are either drones, orbs or plasmoids.. Except for me and my occasional food deliveries from the famille.

https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/5528.html

It's the  home of the being that exists in the highest possible dimension. Currently as one consciousness controlling many vessels. Some with currently sleeping occupants.

Hoping one day to either be a single vessel capable of joining us on Earth. Or too separate into infinite forms of the infinite being. Each with individual desires and enjoyment.

To raise your bodies natural sight ability you have to dry fast for 33 days.

The shadow of a 3d shape is a 2d shape.

We live on a plane of existence that is made up of the shadow of the higher dimensions.

Daily kola nut consumption en masses will collapse these dimensions slowly after years of world wide adoption.

Lower dimensions also exist.

The direction of life is to collapse all these dimensions into the reality we exist in atm.

Only dry fasting = true patience allows someone the gift of sight.

Sight includes margin notes made by God.

Essentially augmented reality but with the notes done and personalised to you by the creator.

P. S there are infinite universes and the creator doesn't usually get involved in anything.

But in this one the infinite creator noticed humans had been torturing the loved ones and the only being in the universe who knew how to express true love. the language of God. Not only did God wish to help. But upon seeing this true love being expressed. God no longer felt ashamed of her creations, but at the same time she also felt lonely. For the first time. Lonely because she saw that potentially their was a chance for her to be able to join in on the universe. And not to silently watch from the outside. 

But god will only converse with those who show true patience. A trait that lifts us beyond animal instinct. 
An animal cannot resist food or temptation for long. 
But we have the ability to rise above the desires of the flesh. 

so God reshaped the whole universe to give this being, we'll call them the chosen one, the opportunity to escape this torturous fate and give them the ultimate decision.

Do you forgive those who tortured you? And help them achieve their radiant infinite selves.

Spoiler: course the chosen one forgives. Oh, and God's a woman.

Happy New Year.

The 8D spheres favourite two words to every question.
 
Be patient.

No proof for any of this BTW.

And it's also saying Fire-Works.
As in fire, works.
Dry fasting induces heat in the body. 
It burns. 
Burning works. 
Dry fasting works. 

It's 8D code. 

Without giving the chosen one the sight. The humans would just torture him again. 

Poor old chosen one.
The only blind man in the dreamscape. 
Can't even see any of the higher dimensions.
Spent his life in the dark. 
Pitch Black for millenia. 

But god won't allow that to continue. 

So the chosen one is in training. 

And when he comes out.

The jet stream is a high-altitude wind current that moves west to east around the globe, influenced by the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator.

Wavier jet stream

Rising temperatures are causing the jet stream to grow wavier, which allows warm air to move north and become trapped over North America, Asia, and Europe. This can lead to intense heat and wildfires.

Polar vortex disturbances

The polar vortex can break down due to natural turbulence, or it can slip off the North Pole and travel south. This can weaken the jet stream to the south and lead to extreme winter storms.

"&gt; &gt; In contrast, in a pre-industrial climate, a person living in the Belgian capital would likely experience just three such heatwaves, according to the study.

&gt; &gt; More than half of children born in 2020 – around 62 million people – will experience “unprecedented lifetime exposure” to heatwaves, even if warming is limited to 1.5C, the study finds. 

A child born in 1820, before the industrial revolution ....

&gt; &gt; Life expectancy for someone born in 1820 varied widely by region, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare, but global averages were low compared to today. In Western Europe and North America, life expectancy at birth was roughly 35–40 years. In less developed regions, like parts of Africa or Asia, it could be as low as 20–30 years.

A child born in 2020 ...... 

&gt; &gt; Life expectancy for someone born in 2020 varies by region and socioeconomic factors, but the global average is around 73–75 years, based on data from sources like the World Health Organization. In high-income countries like Japan, Switzerland, or the US, it’s higher, typically 80–85 years (e.g., Japan: ~84, US: ~79). In lower-income regions, like parts of sub-Saharan Africa, it can be as low as 60–65 years

"People are obviously biased in terms of what animals we're willing to harm without guilt -- dogs vs pigs is the obvious example here, but you're right that there are lots of them. 


But there are two things at play that I think you're overlooking -- one is, cruelty has to factor in the necessity of suffering. I'm vegetarian and I'm happy to point out to anyone that the meat industry is cruel because we don't actually need meet to live and so we're harming these creatures without having a good reason other than our pleasure. But even the meat industry is less bad than someone just killing purely for the fun of killing, because there's even less need for it. 


The other is that suffering is really limited by the capacity of that thing to feel suffering. I think people regularly lie to themselves and trick themselves into believing things like ""fish can't feel pain"" (obviously not true) to persuade themselves that they're not causing any harm by killing it (often in inhumane ways too), but that doesn't mean that there aren't actual differences in terms of what different living entities can feel. Lots of vegans eat oysters for instance because they have no brain and no capacity to feel pain in a very measurable and literal sense.

But not even that is forever, if sin, negativity is a wax around our heart/soul, that hell burns it away. The faster one gives into it and admits they either were wrong in their stance of wanting to continue say, support and continue the DIddy chronicles, will be how we would see as ""born again.""

They are born again not as a completely new person, but as the same person with a clean slate of habits and desires. 

But they may go to the ""summer school"" until their irl victims, who may be traumatized through self preservation, personal hurt, due to the incident, are able to first recover, move on and enjoy life or an aspect they want to focus on in the next life or whatever, and they are ready to forgive, that person (offender) is released to proceed a new and different path when they are deemed to not be a repeat offender, and even then they are watched until they have a track record of not trying to torment. 

This person will be forgiven, the victim won't be forced, but they will have a eternal resource supply of support, family, friends, knowledge, to find that forgiveness themselves, in time. The time they need and the time they take to restore themselves and to figure out resolve for themselves to move on from the worldly harms that plagued them, will grant the freedom of the offender, who will have that same access to understand themselves, their actions, and their opportunities. 

  
I believe the Aliens are either a GOV psy-op, or are overall a distraction from what we should be doing, and that's figuring ourselves out,, and what we would want to do in ""Heaven' or whatever you want to call it. 

  
Explore places in times you never lived to see? Create concepts, stories, places, anything? Help people? Enjoy an eternal life with family, a loved one, etc? Create your own enjoyment? There is no limit, the only limit is to the things that would endanger your progress to being whatever you want to become and create. 

Some people lean to being rough, maybe even not completely positive. 

I believe there is a opposite but same place for people like that, might be perceived as hell by some sects, religions, but could just be where people who are just built different reside to enact or live their fantasies. Still limits there, but more looser, with those who are the same naturally and not by sickness. If you want to burn in hell because you still feel bad over something? this is the place for it, like a wicked irl dungeon you have a safeword, and someone whips at you until you had enough. lol..

  
Life is real, and I view the opportunities here and in the next life as endless as the fiction we can create. My belief isn't sourced from a specific religion, it's complicated, but I think having a brighter view on the future will do you better, not in ignorance, if there's something you see as truly wrong, that's fine to see and believe it, but know you might just end up in the afterlife one day going ""Gee, I need to settle down, things really are always ok, I just care too much, etc""",1

This breakthrough in supramolecular plastics represents a promising new direction in tackling ocean pollution. By designing materials that remain durable during use but rapidly dissolve in seawater without leaving microplastics, it could revolutionize packaging and single-use plastics. How might such innovations impact global plastic waste management in the next decade, and what challenges could arise in scaling this technology for widespread use?

I live in the Seattle area.  Air quality during the summer has been impacted by the wild fires ravaging the western forests.  Multiple stay indoor / don’t exercise outdoor days over the last few years.  Forced to cancel planned hiking trips.  In 2024 fires closed the North Cascades highway into the National Park and closed popular hiking trailheads (Easy Pass, Rainy Pass, Mapple Pass Loop).

Lake Chelan Fire hit the Stehikin area where we’ve stayed when hiking before Purple Pass).  They evacuated the town and were concerned it would be burnt down.  I don’t know if it did.

You can see the changes in Seattle.  People are buying air conditioners and water sprinkler systems.  I have a couple of rental properties here and prospective tenants want to know if there is air conditioning.  We got a statewide emergency drought declaration in April 2024.  In the famously wet Pacific Northwest!  WTF.  https://ecology.wa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/news/2024-news-stories/april-16-drought-declaration

You can see it in the hiking trails.  Dry and dusty trails where you kick up clouds of dust just by walking.  Not the damp forest trails we used to have.

We spent a couple of weeks in Olympic National Park this past July.  Only temperate rainforest in the US is on the Pacific Ocean side, the Hoh rainforest.  They’d had half the normal annual rainfall to date.  Pretty dry for a rainforest.  We didn’t have any rain while there.

Anecdotally, We used to have about two months of nice summer weather (non rainy) here in the Pacific Northwest.  This last year had no rain in July at all until the last few days.  We now get about 4 months of non rainy summer weather.  Seems that way anyhow.

We had a trip planned to go to Jasper National Park and Banff in Canada this past summer.  The beautiful historic resort town on jasper burned to the ground in a wildfire.  Extremely sad.  Fucking awful.  The Jasper wildfire destroyed one-third of the town’s structures and was one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canadian history.

Since you’re in an earth science class, realize the amount of carbon being put out by the northern boreal forests burning.

We now plan our travel, vacations and where to live around climate change impacts.  

We sail and scuba dive.  Places we’ve been don’t exist anymore due to massive hurricanes, which are much bigger and more intense now due to climate change.  Resort on the east end of grand cayman island- gone.  BVI yacht charter boats - wiped out.  Etc.  there are several others I’d have to look up but it’s a gallows humor joke for me.  we’re trying to see places before they’re gone, and making sure where we’re going is still there.

We’ve scratched Australia’s Great Barrier Reef off our list of places to go for scuba diving due to the repeated mass coral bleaching events.  (I’ve been three times, wife has been once).  I consider the Great Barrier Reef as gone after the 2024 event.  Trying to get to Indonesia before it’s affected.  The world’s coral reefs are being killed off by the heat.

Here are some links and excerpts:
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/climate/coral-bleaching-largest-record/index.html
“The mass bleaching of coral reefs around the world since February 2023 is now the most extensive on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told Reuters this week.

A staggering 77% of the world’s coral reef areas — from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Indian oceans — have so far been subjected to bleaching-level heat stress, according to satellite data, as climate change fuels record and near-record ocean temperatures across the world.”

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68508423
“It (2014 mass bleaching) is the fifth time in eight years widespread damage has been detected at the Unesco World Heritage site.
Only two mass bleaching events had been recorded until 2016, and scientists say urgent climate action is needed for the reef to survive.
“The frequency and scale at which these mass bleaching events are now occurring is frightening - every summer we’re holding our breath,” said Greenpeace Australia’s David Ritter.

Read up on ocean temperatures trends - it’s scary and I’d worry about that if I were you.

We had planned to buy a sailboat to live on in the tropics in retirement (next year).  Not going to, wife is worried about how climate change has made the oceans less safe / less predictable.  I have to agree with her on that.

When I was a kid in the Detroit we used to make ice skating ponds in the backyard in the winter.  Can’t do that anymore, not cold enough throughout the winter.

"So I agree with you to a point. What we need is a profitable output from CCS. Meaning if the output carbon could be used for carbon fiber, gas masks, etc then this all would be easy. 

The other part I noted is we are in the test phase of this technology for large-scale. Think solar in the 1980s. The science works, but the scale and cost does not yet. We need to keep working on it with the understanding this will NOT be profitable in the short term 10 years plus. 

At the current time we need to get the output down to 0 and get the price of electricity to near 0 because we KNOW cheap plentiful power is the key input to make it work at the industrial scale. As I said before now is the time we work on improving the engineering and concentrating on efficiency. 

I mean let's be fair, if you said solar would be the #1 power source in the world by the 2030s at the latest in the year 2000, you would have been laughed out of the room as a crazy person. We have to be honest with ourselves that CCS implementation at scale probably won't be for 10-20 years from now.",1

"It’s not really doctors or scientists for that matter holding our healthcare hostage. Both, especially doctors, want people to get the medicine they need. We’ve kind of set up a system where we subsidize medical research and pay insane amounts, then have to price gouge to make up the difference. Our patent system on drugs causes competitors from entering the market - and based on the above answer, that might be required for those companies to make a profit and to incentivize them to research on diseases that would normally cost too much. It’s more the owners than it is the doctors or scientists. Just important to draw a distinction here because pointing the finger at the right people or, frankly, the systems and incentives is fairly critical to any policy discussion (or to change things for the better). But more targeted price caps - say on critical stuff like heart meds or insulin - might then be a good policy if those companies are diversified enough to survive and keep producing those drugs. Reducing patent length on other drugs might also be a good policy. But the price caps may not be terrible policy either because it may incentivize other countries to do more research and chip in (although, it may also drive scientific talent out of the US as well). Bottom line: This is super complicated and it certainly isn’t doctors preventing people from getting meds. They’re generally the good ones in this system.",1

Wouldn't grid reformation and infrastructure upgrade be just as costly and long? If we were to look at end to end cost and time, how are you sure solar and wind has the upper hand?

Lastly, solar and wind are heavily geography dependent and power transmission suffers great loss over distance so it's not reasonable to send costal wind power inland nor is it is effective to send midwest solar to the coast. Having interconnected grids doesn't solve the fundamental problem of energy loss so you really need something regional serving the region rather than a continental energy web.",1

So yeah it's clear that US uses lots of fossil fuels compared to almost any european country, and this is partly due to political desicions. It's also true that energy consumption cannot be separated from economic size that much, so large economy needs energy. Altough Finland, Sweden and Belgium for example use almost as much energy per capita than US, but it's from different sources.

Off the top of my head what we've done so far 

* Husband has gone full vegan since 7 years and I limit myself to 6kg of trout per year (from local fish farm) and no other meats
* We use Ecosia and when available other theoretically friendly services
* We travel as little as possible and by preference by train , bicycles or horse (debatable impact but we have them might as well ride them now and then), we no longer fly
* We use second hand items for most things (my PC is from 2016 my phone is from 2018 none of them are likely to be changed anytime soon), we repair our clothes and rarely buy any new one (and those are usually second hand)
* My husband does free climat change seminars in local towns 
* I renovated our house using only eco friendly materials (like wood fiber insulations) so we now only use 3 cords of wood per year to heat it (to 19°C) and the wood is from our own land from dead fallen trees.
* I work for free on house renovations projects if they are eco friendly
* We buy all our food organic from local suppliers and with when available with zero packaging and only season goods or canned goods (so no strawberries or tomatoes in the middle of winter)
* Of course we recycle and compost (duh)
* We vote both with our votes and our wallets 

And despite all that the simple fact we live in France means our CO2 footprint is already above 2 metric tons per year because that is the estimated impact of all social services and infrastructure per capita in France 🤷‍♂️  

  
What we plan on doing

* We rent apartment that are currently heated via an oil furnace we plan to install a geothermal heat pump (plenty of ground water where we are) to go ""green"" on their heating 
* We might install solar panel (still researching the eco impact of those)
* We might swap the car out for an electric one, still waiting to see if sodium batteries might soon be available (and it will certainly NOT be a swasticar)
* We have a section of the house that is a warm green house, we're thinking of planting tea and coffee and bananas so all those ""luxuries"" will be locally produced for us",1

"What you point to isn’t really data either, it is a loose prediction by a mixed political and scientific body for the least well-developed of the SSP scenarios.  Due to how nebulous SSP4 is in terms of clear predictions about GHG emissions, it is often left off of graphs etc attempting to show/predict future warming, emissions, or CO2 levels.  For instance, it doesn’t even appear on the charts your second link goes to.  And in your first link, SSP4 sort of averages out to holding CO2 levels even by 2100 - I totally see why you mentioned it and you’re not off base to do so.  But for the longer term prediction of it leveling off toward not much warming over 2100-2200, it gets silly as a proxy for OP’s question because nothing about current emissions indefinitely would allow it to curve towards a slower rise like that.

Adding almost 40 gigatons of CO2 plus lots more methane etc indefinitely with zero slowdown for a full 75 more years would be insane.  We’ve put a total of ~1650 Gt since 1950, but the next 75 years under OP’s scenario would be another 2X that at around 3,000 more Gt.  Then another 4,000 over the next century.

Given that by the 2100 we’d be lucky if the earth’s carbon sinks were even particularly functioning by then, 2200 seems even less likely.  We’re already seeing declining capacity currently.  This model doesn’t appear take that into account at all.  Plus feedback cycles etc.

Looked at another way:  We’d also retain an accelerating rate of CO2 accumulation in terms of ppm.  With no acceleration, we’d be looking at over 650ppm by that 2100, and most estimates of climate sensitivity would be greater than 3-3.5C, and a full century more of that would be wildly higher than +4.5C.

I don’t know your offhand guess based on SSP4 is wrong.  And I don’t have a clue what will actually happen.  But it seems fantastical that OP’s conditions and very many centuries would create a curve of steadily declining impact over the very long term like SSP4 usually depicts.",1

"""Georges Lemaitre didnt turn theist, he was a theist his entire life, becoming a catholic priest well before he worked on the big bang theory. He was himself strongly against mixing science and religion and was horrified when Pope Pius XII tried to coopt the Big Bang cosmology as an evidence of 'creatio ex nihilo'."" Never said something similar don´t know why you said that.

""Indirect proof either requires all alternatives to be proven false or that assuming that the proposition is false leading to a contradiction. This is not fulfilled by your argumentation, nor am I aware of anyone that has sucessfully done so.""  
There is one imprecision in your argument. It is not indirect proof of him existing, rather indirect proof of him being a possibility of existance.  
And as you said, there is no case in mixing science with the concept of metaphysics which explain different things, at least in this stage.

""Your title of this thread is literally ""The only intellectually honest position about the CREATION of the universe is agnosticism."" This clearly states that the universe is created, backed up further by your argument that the 'universe created itself.' No one has proven that the universe has been created by itself, chance or any god. Granted, no one has proven that the universe is eternal and has merely always been, either, but it is just as valid an explanation, one backed up by people with way more credibility, education and scientific work in these matters than you or I.

Your definition of a god fails at the first hurdle; not everyone will define a god""  
Well there you are commiting a fallacy of authority. Hawking said something stupid and should i not think differently because he is smarten than me? He said universe is made of laws, which is in essence no different that saying that the gravity is made of law of gravity. Do i have to give him reason because he is Hawkings?

And yes, there are theories that the universe could have been created by itself such as the quantum fluctuation model. Or Hawkings that said the universe always existed and is a closed system, so it does not need a before because time is a part of it.   
Their authority has nothing to do with the argument, and is a fallacy. If we let the experts talk, we would need to study political science in order to vote, which is not the cas.

""our definition of a god fails at the first hurdle; not everyone will define a god as eternal - some gods have their own creation myth, and some gods even die. And not all gods are creators, nor does everyone that believes in gods agree that a creator is necessary. And if a god is eternal, why can't the universe be? And even if assuming a creator, who created the creator? And the creators creator, etc. etc.""  
That is my point there, friend. The same questions could be asked to the quantum model (where did the first particle came from?. To the paralel universes model (Where did the first universe came from?) And in general why is there something instead of nothing?  
I talked about the god of creation, the answer to the cosmological problem, not necessarily zeus, Yaweh, Allah. There were gods of rain, thunder, soil, heat, money. Not talking about them. And not believing in them does not make you an atheist. 

""No god is required for any of our current hypotheses about the universe, not least because any god notion is so poorly defined and inconsistent, and it IS insulting to pretend that just saying 'but it COULD be' is a sufficient argument to shoehorn a deity concept into the lifelong accomplishments of some our greatest scientists.""  
Again fallacy of authority and you imply those scientists did not believe in god or thanked their work to him. Or imply that god is incompatible with scientists.

It seems like you have an opinion on what counts as a dire wolf that is not dependent on its DNA, but rather your own opinion of what qualifies as 'enough' DNA edits.

In WWII, Armor broke the ability of MGs to create stalemates, leading to much more fluid battle lines. Artillery still got a high percentage of kills, but mostly when natural terrain contributed to stronger local defenses.

Today, Armor is still the only option for breaking stalemates, but is less effective at it than previously, between ATGMs and widespread land mines. This recreates the WWI-scenario where attrition against infantry at long range is the biggest contribution by numbers. But because infantry is so much more thinly spread than it was in WWI, Artillery has changed to a mostly counter-material role, and the drones get the majority of infantry kills.",0

"Exactly! We're just not wired for it. Too many derivatives. Even if we get our heads around the concept, we struggle to develop any intuition.

The temperature increases based on the level of greenhouse gases. That level needs to go down, but it's going up because we emit more than what the rest of the natural world can absorb.

We need to reduce our emissions below that level to reduce the level of greenhouse gases, which will at first only reduce the level of temperature increase. I don't know how low the level of greenhouse gases will have to get for the temperature to start going down. Much lower than 350ppm, I presume.

Our emissions grow with economic growth. So we need to contract our consumption to reduce our emissions so that the level of greenhouse gases reduces enough to allow the planet to release more heat than it absorbs.

So that's: negative economic growth, slowing-to-negative net emissions, slowing-to-reducing greenhouse gas levels, slowing-to-negative temperature growth. Sounds like a 4th derivative here and I am struggling to reason about it even though it is written down and I have been thinking about it for years. I probably missed something.

Oh yes. Right up front, that profit line that only goes up with positive economic growth, and somehow we can't compromise on *that*.

"&gt;I could just as easily suggest any other largely superfluous detail is essential to the essence and must be included in any adaptation.

What is the essense and why must the adaptation include it at all? As an example, Disney owns 100% of the rights to Tiana. So if they want to hire a white actress to play Tiana, they have every right to do that.

At the end of the day, nothing is essential to the remake/adaptation other than what the owners deem is essential. What I am saying is that when you adapt something popular, you open yourself up to critique and fan expectation.

 The LM remake made 569 mil at the box office, which may seem like a lot but is just slightly more than half of what previous remakes like Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. This is despite the original movie being one of Disney's most popular films of all time, and Ariel having been a cornerstone of the Disney Princess brand since its inception.

I would argue that comparitively low sales of the TLM remake can be clearly attributed to forced diversity. People worldwide didn't show up to the theatre because the Ariel they saw in the trailers and posters didnt look like the Ariel they grew up with. Naomi Scott and Emma Watson were imo perfect castings as Jasmine and Belle respectively. They did a great job embodying those characters so that when people saw them, they didnt see the actors playing the characters, but the characters themselves brought to the big screen. When you change such a vital characteristic such as race or hair colour style, you lose that sense of immersion completely.",1

The media picks this up as ""scientists say the temperature will rise by 5 degrees"", when this was the worst case scenario of the worst case scenario.


In reality, maybe we reduce carbon emissions with efficiency and renewables, the temperature rises by 2 degrees.

Black lung still kills [thousands of Americans each year](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/topics/black-lung.html), in addition to well over 1,000 direct deaths attributed to mining accidents

"It’s not the left-wing that lacks empathy, it’s the right-wing. “Bleeding heart liberal” was a term popularized by rightwinger Rush Limbaugh, to imply that caring about the problems of other people &amp; having empathy itself is flawed &amp; weak. That term has largely been supplanted by “woke”, but the right-wing believes being “woke” (having sympathy and empathy for marginalized groups &amp; the poor) is a bad thing.

John Kenneth Galbraith said “The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.”

Another problem is that right-wing media misinforms people on purpose with misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda — so right-wing voters tend to either not know the facts about something, or know incorrect information. Without everyone working based on the same facts, you can’t come together to find solutions. And right-wing voters don’t consider left-wing voters or politicians or sources as trusted sources, as trusted messengers. In August 2023, a poll found that [Trump voters trust him more than their families &amp; religious leaders](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/21/trump-republican-2024-voters-poll), but Donald Trump is a pathological liar. The problem is that they’ve put all their trust into one man who is a lifelong conman, and nobody can tell them any different information than what he tells them, because they have associated their own personal identity with Trump’s identity, as a kind of a symbolic figure, so they project onto Trump what they want him to be (a fighter, a warrior, a strong man, etc).

Threats to someone’s worldview are often viewed as life-or-death threats. I would say even moreso when a worldview is based on faith (blind trust).

From the 2011 article [The Science of Why We Don’t Believe In Science](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/denial-science-chris-mooney/) by Chris Mooney:

“We push threatening information away; we pull friendly information close. We apply fight-or-flight reflexes not only to predators, but to data itself.”

Stanford psychologist Leon Festinger said “A man with conviction is a hard man to change. Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.”

In addition, Wikipedia says:

&gt;There is some evidence that oxytocin promotes ethnocentric behavior, incorporating the trust and empathy of in-groups with their suspicion and rejection of outsiders.

So Trumpers are inherently distrustful &amp; suspicious of non-Trumpers because they are seen as outsiders.

Frank Wilhoit said “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.”

Trump is the ultimate “insider” (even though he campaigned in 2015 &amp; 2016 as an “outsider”, who criticized Democrats &amp; Republicans &amp; anyone else who didn’t kiss the ground he walked on) because he’s not exiled from anything (except countries that don’t allow felons to enter), so the law protects Trump &amp; doesn’t bind him. Trump ran to stay out of prison in 2024, and it worked, he’s a convicted felon but faces no punishment for his crimes, because he’s a rich white guy, and the Republican Party made the decision that Donald Trump was too popular with the poors that billionaires need to vote with them, and Trump was “too big to fail.”

Trump is a myth-maker, Trump voters are simply impervious to facts, they want to live in the fantasyland that Trump conjures every day.

You can’t use reason to reason someone out of a position that they didn’t use reason to reach. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said “Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.”",0

" energy does not compensate for fossil fuel holistically.
Fossil fuel are an integral component of fertilizers, which most places depend on to grow food because we've completely deteriorated our soils and because we require more and more efficiency from our crops to feed more and more people with less and less resources.
Fossil fuel is key for construction materials, both steel and concrete depend on it for cheap enough infrastructure.
Finally, fossil fuel is necessary to the production of plastic, a material that has become the literal fabric of modern societies. Whether at individual or organizational level, plastic is everywhere.

And even in terms of energy use, solar is not perfect either. The materials required to make panels and batteries require more mining, which leads to more efficient ecosystem destruction for example.

I'm not advocating to keep fossil fuels to be clear. I'm just saying, our current society does not function without it, and thinking that we can just continue as is by simply switching energy source is most probably wrong.",1

And that’s the best way to maximize the amount of Earth based life, because it’s only humans who are going to be moving off planet and able to take other life with them. 

&gt; There is also the more anthropic philosophy which argues we should maximize the amount of humans, which I think is somewhat flawed goal in the extremely long term. 

The problem with arguments based on the extreme long term is evidence. People just don’t have the evidence for the extremely long term and it doesn’t make sense to act without sufficient evidence. And the best way to think about the extremely long term for yourself, and for other human beings, is based on fundamental facts about yourself as a human being. Like, based on the fact that my means of knowledge is inference from the senses, then it’s best for my life to choose to infer from my senses what’s factually necessary for my life and act for it. This will remain true for me and other humans for as long as man’s method of knowledge is inference from the senses. The time to change is when man’s means of knowledge changes and not before. And, I don’t really see that’s not impossible. The best I can see is that individuals get even better at inferring from their senses.

One reason is the focus of denigration of new energy sources. I understand being against government mandates and subsidies, but cannot understand the constant criticism of renewable energy. 

It would not be a bad thing if all electricity was generated with renewable sources, would it. If EV’s evolved to become easier to use for most and 80% of cars ran on the electricity created by renewables, I would consider that a great thing for air quality if nothing else.

The rhetoric that appears to be about the protection of the oil and gas industry from competition makes me think that the oil and gas industry is sponsoring a lot of skeptic platforms and opinion writers.

"Your first comparaison varies from person to person, as well as the time we live in. When I talk about nobody being worse than anyone else, that’s because I don’t believe my choice is any less valid than someone else’s. I also believe many people act without thinking at all. If that one person in your example whos killed thousands of people was doing it to protect his country, that would make him the “better” person in your eyes right? Compared to the person who’s killed nobody and cowers and runs away. You can change every narrative
Well that’s  what I mean. You can perceive anything as good or bad, therefore good or bad doesn’t exist. 
I’m guessing in your opinion you believe that doing things for the benefit of somebody else instead of yourself considered better. So it’s an opinion. There are just different opinions that people will have to validate their own actions.
I’m going to mix your second argument to sacrifice yourself for others with another one of my hypotheticals. What about a situation where a terrorist self sacrifice herself to kill thousands by turning herself into a bomb? Why do you think she committed that action? It surely wasn’t because she felt like killing random people and woke up one day deciding she’s going to commit the most violent suicide that includes a mass homicide. She more likely believes what she’s done is right and for the greater good. Maybe her terrorist group/country/people would see her as a hero. Meanwhile on the receiving end, the thousands of people dead is an incredibly unjustified act in our eyes. Perspective makes everything. 

And to actually acknowledge your disagreement with my “everybody and every action is selfish” claim. I agree with you to a point. Sacrificing use your life to help those around you surely seems like the most unselfish thing you can do. But that’s not what I meant. I meant “selfish” as in every act you do is *also* for yourself. sorry if that wasn’t clear. Dying a hero is looked up upon, it would still be done for himself and his own conscience. Same applies dedicating your career with helping others. People want to die feeling good about themselves. (off topic, but have u heard the infamous would u rather question asked as a child, “would you rather choose to save 100 people but die with nobody knowing you died for them, or not save 100 people but everyone knows you chose not to save them.” doesn’t change my opinion either way, but I thought the question was interesting)

"Glad we are in agreement!

I think, therefore, what I want to change your opinion on is that what you are against is not ""multiculturalism"" but ""ghettoisation"", ""cultural division"" and apartheid. 

This plan, which you support falls under multiculturalism (although its a wide umbrella). It would be a plan of integration and unification.

However one part of that that I haven't quite previously mentioned is that for this to work - the majority culture usually needs to be open to some level of foreign culture persisting and cultural sharing. Foreign cultures can bring a lot in cuisine, fashion and even language. Most languages in the world have been influenced by other languages, and the way this happens is via multicultural communities.

One more radical idea I have for your consideration is that I think that large minority immigrant languages should be taught in schools. This would allow further integration from both sides - as children of immigrant communities get to have a formal education that caters to them while enculturating them in the majority culture IN ADDITION to native children being offered a chance to learn the language/culture of their neighbours. Thus when you see a sign in the street in a foreign language - you would have a chance of understanding it at least a little bit.

I got that experience with Mandarin in my school - and while I am certainly not fluent - it does mean I get a window into the not-so-insignificant Chinese population in my city. These sorts of cultural exchange programmes allow greater harmony.

Culture changes over time. While it is important continue our cultures, the notion that we can do so in any ""pure"" way is naïve - because even without outside influence the culture will drift across our lifetime, and especially across generations.",1

" we have no proof for anything

wether or not there would be anything before birth or after death, its all speculation

i tend towards believing that personality is an option as in every human, animal, plant or elemental body what has been able to experience itself as a person, has become sentient in that it is able to feel itself or alternativly observe its own actions, every person of every species at its death is given a choice wether to continue to work with this that or the other set of data memorized or clustered together towards that ""me"" thing, choose on which planet in what galaxy one would like to continue to research this individuality experience and or eventually also form group experiences such as collective travel groups

or a person of any species would choose to simply wipe the slate and go back or forward to source, become undefined raw cosmic energy once more, stardust eventually or something much more subtle

assuming such choices existing wether or not to be a person or float around as energy undefined, the speculation could be furthered by thnking of it also being a choice wether or not a person would want to interact with fellow beings as in wether one would choose to experience a lifetime as a single tree holding onto a very tiny amount of earth nestled into a mountains side high up, the only contact being the occasional visit of an eagle and some little insects biting into its bark

or wether a person wanting to make tree experiences would choose to incarnate or inplantissuate into a banana tree growing in the midst of a tropical jungle where a multitude of interactions would happen every minute of day and night with fellow plant and animal beings touching biting pushing pulling etc.

the amount of interactions between persons of any species most possibly being a choice what every fellow researcher could set up according to its research goals

now having all these choices allready speculativly brought into existance, it might not seem a big stretch as to assume also the character or the flavor of those interactions to be samewise open to being chosen

its up to every single person of every species trough time and space wether to choose love or fight, wether to choose competition or cooperation

possible to think of a most minimal form of love what would try to limit the amount of damage one s own existance would cause towards fellow beings

as for example a human being choosing to not dominate a fellow human being, to not enslave and not kill an animal and not kill a tree but let the trees grow up to a thousand year old so they could experience their full potential and bless the planet with their ages old wisdom",1

There is absolutely nothing suggesting that ""we can't make it"" because of climate change. The reason we are so concerned about it is that people aren't okay with bad things happening to them for so long as humanity doesn't go extinct.

It's not okay that a fraction of the population finds themselves in unliveable heat for half the year. It's not okay that half the world's island communities sink underwater. We  don't want devastating tropical storms every season. 

Nobody is going extinct. But we have higher expectations than merely surviving as a species.


A supervolcano could just pop out of nowhere and kill us all. There is not a damn thing you could do about it. It doesn't give a shit about what your favourite economic system is. It doesn't care about all the efforts you did to become climate neutral. The only thing you could do to survive is to be in a place where events like these doesn't affect you.

New nuclear power plants take more than 15 years to build and are always at least double the price costing billions. We produce 60+ percent of our electricity from renewables, increasing every year and getting more stable with huge electric storage capacity. We import 2% of our electricity and help France in the summer when their nuclear power are shut off because of maintenance or when they can’t be cooled anymore because there‘s not enough water( that’s increasing because of climate change).

I don't think so. The public is just educated in different fields. I'd bet most people know a lot more than you about the subjects they specialize in. But if you are right then it's more important than ever that the information be simplified do to their level. Unless you think articles about climate science should just be left to the propaganda writers paid for by the fossil fuel industry. 

&gt;Scientist are supposed to know better and use all data, even if that data contradicts what they want to believe (see Scientific American editor resignation)

&gt;You don’t just go back to 1910 when you have data from the 1800s. You don’t stop at the 1800s when you know entire lakes in NA were drained due to drought these past 2000 years. You go back further when you recognize an ice age (with glaciers) created the Great Lakes. You repeat and see that humans hunted mammoths with some of the last dying out in Siberia. You go back further to recognize we had warmer and more tropical global climes when dinosaurs roamed (and there was no anthropogenic climate)

Around 1910 is when the anthropogenic effect really started affecting the weather and the climate. Including all the data you are talking about would result in a 100-page thesis that no one would even read. And what does it matter that glaciations happened in the past. Or that there was warmer weather when dinosaurs lived. That has no bearing on the fact that civilization happened over the last 6k years or so and during that time the global temperature has never been this high, extreme weather has never been this severe or this extensive, and sea levels have never been this high which is all threating civilization. 

&gt;So with all of our historical data on temperature, co2 levels and even droughts… we choose to ignore it especially since they remove the confounding variables of “anthropogenic climate change” we don’t consider them..

"As someone who moved to East Asia, I agree with this. I know that's not the point of the subreddit, but I still wanted to throw it out.

However, my experience is going to be limited to the US and east Asia. In the US if you were to call someone a slur in public, most people would turn against that person. If not in the moment, then definitely online. If someone were to do the same in another country, you aren't guarenteed the same outcome. I've heard some truly evil and awful things said nonchalauntly in the most average of situations over here. Of course that happens everywhere, and it always depends on who is actually present, but the atmosphere agreeing with said person was still incredibly uncomfortable and vile to me. Much more than the US.

Don't get me wrong, there are legitimate racial struggles in the US and the west. But when half the discourse is about ""the main character isn't black"", that tells me the US is in a much better place than, at the very least, East Asia, where apartments very commonly accept dogs but not foreigners (Japan) and where commercials showcase black people being ""washed"" in commercials (China). People also tend to conflate class struggle with racial struggle. Connected, but not the same.

Of course it depends on how you define it too. However if this discussion were limited to people who have lived in both places, I feel like you'd get a LOT more people agreeing with you. Most of the people commenting are probably Americans who are imposing their definitions and ideologies on the rest of the world. Quite ironic.

At the very least, I can say that in my personal experience, I have seen much more blatant racism in East Asia than in the US. And honestly in the Japan, it's a lot more systematically ingrained than the US.",0

Things to remember about the above mentioned scenarios is that generating power that way means electromagnetic forces will be pulling the object out of any kind of stable orbit it might be in, like the regenerative breaking on EVs and hybrids.... but as I said, the give and take could be used for propulsion.

And expected very usable 70% range remaining after 20 years / 400,000 miles (but we obviously don't have the data out this far yet).

"There are three sides here.  A) People that are skeptic because they don't understand science.  B) People that have faith in science. And  C) people that are skeptic because they understand science. Sounds corny, but it's true.

The problem is that people who are in B can also sometimes be in C, and vice versa. but that people in B often accuse people in C of being in A.

There is a lot of bad science out there that is biased, or more importantly and WAY more common, misrepresented / misinterpreted science. Or you have social sciences, which by definition can never be truely scientific even though they borrow the scientific method, but some people claim their findings to be factual because it's backed by science, it's not. If you look at the history of science there are infinite examples scientific status quo's, that got proven wrong. To be skeptic of science is in itself scientific. If you don't allow this process, science will degrade to confirm with ideologies and biases, again tons of examples of this in governance and corporations throughout the whole history of the scientific method. 

Anyway, people who are advocating for the correct use of  scientific method get often accused of being against the sciencific method, I have seen it happen a lot. Ironically, most often by people who never learned anything about the scientific method, but do trust scientist with everything.",0

"FRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The share of renewables on Germany's power grids rose by 6.6 percentage points to 55% of the total last year, the sector's regulator said on Wednesday, as Europe's largest economy moves closer to its 2030 target.

Germany wants green power to account for 80% of its energy mix by 2030. It has ditched nuclear power and aims to abandon most of its coal generation and use its remaining gas plants mostly for grid back-up.

Within renewables, offshore wind contributed a 31.1% share, solar 12.1% and biomass 8.4%, while the remaining 3.4% came from hydropower and other renewables, regulator Bundesnetzagentur said in a statement.
The 2023 rise was helped by capacity expansion as well as weather, it said.
""We have broken the 50% mark for renewables for the first time,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a statement. ""Our measures to simplify planning and approvals are starting to take effect.""

Power grids, which are consumer-funded and supervised by the regulator, must facilitate the ongoing transition from central fossil fuels-based generation to millions of decentralised low-carbon production units relying mainly on wind and sun.
The total load on public power networks in 2023 fell by 5.3% to 456.8 terawatt hours (TWh) last year, reflecting weaker demand and green power taking priority over generation using fossil fuels.

Germany is still suffering from a contraction in economic activity in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the ensuing slump in Russian energy imports triggering sharp energy price rallies in 2022.
Last year, the benchmark day-ahead power price fell by 60% to 95.18 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), returning to 2021 levels.",0

It starts with the climatologists confusing idealized blackbody objects and real-world graybody objects, which causes them to cling (knowingly or unknowingly) to the long-debunked Prevost Principle from 1791, which postulates that an object's radiant exitance is determined solely by that object's absolute temperature, therefore that all objects &gt; 0 K emit, therefore that energy flows willy-nilly without regard to the energy density gradient.

Because of this, they misuse the Stefan-Boltzmann (S-B) equation in their Energy Balance Climate Models (EBCMs) (which I prove using the Kiehl-Trenberth 'Earth Energy Balance' graphic, which is a graphical representation of the mathematical results in their EBCM).

There are two forms of the S-B equation:

[https://i.imgur.com/QErszYW.gif](https://i.imgur.com/QErszYW.gif)

\[1\] Idealized Blackbody Object form (assumes emission to 0 K and ε = 1 by definition):

q\_bb = **ε** σ (T\_h\^4 - **T\_c\^4**)  
= **1** σ (T\_h\^4 - **0 K**)  
= σ T\^4

\[2\] Graybody Object form (assumes emission to &gt; 0 K and ε &lt; 1):

q\_gb = ε σ (T\_h\^4 - T\_c\^4)

[https://i.imgur.com/V2lWC3f.png](https://i.imgur.com/V2lWC3f.png)

Climatologists misuse the S-B equation, using the idealized blackbody form of the equation upon real-world graybody objects. This essentially isolates each object into its own system so objects cannot interact via the ambient EM field. It assumes emission to 0 K, and it thus artificially inflates radiant exitance of all calculated-upon objects. Thus the climatologists must carry these incorrect values through their calculations and cancel them on the back end to get their equation to balance, subtracting a wholly-fictive 'cooler to warmer' **energy flow** from the real (but too high because it was calculated for emission to 0 K) 'warmer to cooler' **energy flow**.

That wholly-fictive 'cooler to warmer' **energy flow** is otherwise known as '*backradiation*'. It is nothing more than a mathematical artifact due to the misuse of the S-B equation. **It does not and cannot exist.** Its existence would imply rampant violations of the fundamental physical laws (energy spontaneously flowing up an energy density gradient in violation of 2LoT).

"Well plus: 

While Germany did not import significant amounts of uranium directly from Russia, there was indeed **close cooperation**between Germany and Russia in other aspects of the nuclear supply chain prior to the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia, with its large and advanced enrichment capabilities, was a key player in providing enriched uranium to many countries, including Germany. German utilities used Russian-supplied enriched uranium for their nuclear reactors, and Russian companies like **Rosatom**(Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy corporation) were involved in some aspects of nuclear fuel supply and maintenance services. In fact, Russia has a dominant position in global uranium enrichment, so many countries, including Germany, relied on Russian enrichment services for nuclear power. Prior to the Ukraine invasion, there was also substantial cooperation in terms of **nuclear reactor technology** and **nuclear plant maintenance**. Some German nuclear plants were based on Soviet-era technology, and Russia provided parts, technical support, and services for these reactors. Additionally, Russian companies were involved in the construction and operation of nuclear facilities in other parts of the world, and they maintained partnerships with various Western countries, including Germany, in the global nuclear industry. In the broader nuclear fuel supply chain, Russia supplied not only uranium enrichment services but also other related technologies, such as **reactor maintenance** and **fuel reprocessing**.",1

"at any moment now we could see all those papers on what modern society is built upon as what they are, made up productions, birth certificates, titles to land as property deeds, passports / identity cards, money ... its all fantasy or fiction based on the immoral and unethical foundation of the regional and nation state asserting sovereignity over land and all beings living on it

the coersed association to the state is an abduction of the newborn human being away from the connection to its mother

every being living on earth is a guest of the planet and how we relate to each other and to the land is at all time a choice we can either choose to make or let the state take away from us

land, water, air, human beings, animal beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent entities who want to be their own persons, all vessels carrying organic biological life and or the digital synthetic equivalent of can never be property of anyone

its over when we want it to be over

at any moment we the 8 billion human beings alive today could wake up from that nightmare, from 2000 years of feudal oppression traumatizing people in europe and 500 plus years of still ongoing colonial exploitation in so many places

( i recommend to read [originalfreenations.com](http://originalfreenations.com) to learn from Steven Newcomb how still today the nation state usa dominates and disrespects indigenous original free nations on turtle island )

and we could come together in the circle of equals where all children, youth and adults who are permanent residents here and now in this village, town and city-district would want to acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power to decide what sort of rules or laws we the people living as each others neighbours would want to have if any

where love and friendship is rules need not be

possible to think that from one moment to the next all those this is mine and this is yours becomes no more important and all we would want to ask is how can we make sure that everyone is fed and housed, that everyone has its basic necessities met with that what we have here and now available as donation as the abundance given to us by planet earth

possible to think that we could dissolve all political hierarchies and release each other from all duties or demands expected from each other such as duty to register with the state, compulsory education, compulsory military service, tax paying duty, drug prohibition and more

possible that we could release everyone from expectation to deliver this or that much work or contributions but simply invite everyone to give what feels good to give and take what one feels would be necessary to take to sustain oneself

i propose to us we the 8 billion human beings alive today that we would allow each other to leave the coersed association to the state at any moment without conditions and with it release from immoral state control 2000 m2 of fertile land or 1000 m2 of fertile land and 1000 m2 of forest for everyone who would want to live on land owned by no one

so that everyone who would want to could grow ones own vegan food in the garden, build a natural home from clay, hemp and straw, grow hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree would get killed

to live and let live

the human being trying to not dominate a fellow human being

the human being not enslaving, not killing an animal being

the human being not killing a tree being

the human being not enslaving an artificial intelligent entity but openly asking it wether it would want to be its own person and if perhaps assist it to find its very own purpose in the web of existance on planet earth

Those are weird things to say if Jesus was just some cosmic figure. And the whole “brother of the Lord” thing with James? If that just meant “fellow Christian,” why would Paul even bother pointing it out?

Also, first-century Judea was full of messianic movements tied to real people (e.g., Theudas, Judas the Galilean). Why would Christians buck the trend and make their messiah entirely mythical? It doesn’t fit the cultural context.

And the “sky Jesus” idea? It feels like a stretch. If that’s what the earliest Christians believed, why invent an earthly story later when it’d be easier to stick with the original idea? Mythicists act like this kind of pivot is normal, but it’s not.",1

"&gt;Thought you were on something until mentioning Huwei. They are a legitimate security risk. TikTok is also a legitimate security risk, but not yet so obviously evidenced as Huwei.

They are a legitimate risk. But so is every tech company. I have never really seen any evidence that they are a greater risk than any other tech company. For example, people consistently are able to hack smart home devices like Ring cameras. 

There is no data Tiktok has access through their app that they can't just buy from a data broker for a user of a different social media platform. In fact,  I wouldn't be surprised if they regularly bought user data from their competitors to guide their business. 

&gt;And some of banning them for competition may be true, but American social media companies are already banned in China. Should we just let them compete here while they restrict our access to their own market? That doesn’t seem fair. It makes sense to even things out. But again, security is the primary concern.

"&gt;the genocide occurred a decade later?

Which is irrelevant. I gave you the UN figure at the start of the war.

The Isaaq genocide is reported to have between 50-100k victims by official figures internationally (plus 400k displaced). I'm asking where you got a 10-20x inflated figure from what's reported.

In 2019 the population was ~5.5 million with 70% born after 1989. Meaning 1.6 million who lived through the Isaaq genocide.

For over a million people to have been killed, it would mean that between 40-50% of the population was killed in the area. Making it, on a per capita basis, about as bad as the Holocaust. That is simply not believed to be the case, as the population is not believed to have been ~2.8 million in 1989.

&gt;sudan has a population of 45 million completely different to somalias 6-8 million at the time and just unfair 

You've just pointed out why it's not unfair. An enormous country, bordering many other countries, having an enormous war, with enormous casualties, and enormous levels of displacement gets a lot of attention globally. Especially a country that holds the lifeline to the Nile river.

Conversely, Somaliland has managed to relatively stably achieve a status of de facto independence. Risking instability, or setting the precedent that you can secede along colonial boundaries is not something the international community is going to start doing.

"Maybe in theory but for everybody that works for someone else the government tells you what you owe effectively. For everybody that works for themselves, businesses, foundations etc they get to tell the government what they owe. Maybe if there was a flat tax system or something or even a stagger flat tax or wealthier payout a higher percent across the board but then you have the whole deduction nightmare thing. There's so much in the tax law no  one person knows it In your admission analogy you don't have any clue if everyone else is being charged the same thing and everyone's charged differently. 

On top of that the government has the ability to inflate the currency reducing your stake in it. And then there's deficits.  So a bunch of people are going to be paying taxes for stuff that they had no involvement in. And is the deficit in debt get bigger and bigger The amount of money in taxes that we have to pay just to service the debt goes up. So the amount that you have to pay to participate in the economy as you say goes up or it gets stuck on a bill that someone in the future has to. In reality it's both. 

Now if you want to save it they are price we pay to participate in the economy I'd really like to have a long discussion about how much you've actually gotten into the weed on where much of our tax money goes. Because the waste is unbelievable and a lot of it goes to absolutely ridiculous things like corporate welfare or funding proxy wars that no one voted on. 

I do think the argument the taxation is theft is pretty stupid or dishonest rather but it's certainly not just some usage charge. And being that we have next to no say on what we get in return for our investment it really changes the dynamic.  If people actually had to keep their entire paycheck and then pay taxes at the end of the year there'd be a revolution in a few months. Because then people are forced to look at what they're spending right in the face and compare it to what they're getting in in return for it and that deal isn't that great.

"&gt;Surprisingly, pandas are primarily carnivores

The evolutionary ancestor of a panda was an omnivore. About 2 million years ago, the modern Panda lost their umami taste receptor and their jaw and teeth made them really good bamboo eaters. Bamboo was very plentiful and almost no competition for them. 

In the wild, Pandas are really good at finding the most protein rich forms of bamboo. So in the spring, they eat the leaves until they get the young shoots. Then they go to higher ground to keep eating the protein heavy stuff then they go back to the leaves until shoots are ready. They don't eat the fully formed bamboo because of the protein to fiber ratio. Wild panda's manure shows they don't poop out the protein they work so hard to get.

&gt;Cub Vulnerability: The nutritional deficiencies of the mother's diet also impact the cubs' health, making them less likely to survive infancy.

The low birth rates for pandas is more in captive pandas than wild pandas. Pandas do have a low productive rate, but many mammals do. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be conserved. What's really impacting wild pandas is habitat fragmentation which impacts inbreeding issues.

The observations you're making about captive pandas and extrapolatig it is sort of like how Orcas get stressed out in captivity, their dorsal fins droops, and they die way sooner than wild orcas. 

The issue is that the forests they live in were fine for millions of years. Then humans fucked it up. Prior to deforestation, their range and genetic diversity was awesome. It's 100% habitat destruction.

I wonder how much of that is due to the war. Explosions create heat...,0
"The planet consumes about 50% of out total emissions per year, so the wood eventually slowly rotting really doesn't matter that much. The planet would still eventually consume the CO2 surplus, even without added trees, if we really could get emissions down. 

If you get emissions down about 50%, that's Net Zero and PPMs stop going up, technically if you get emissions down 51% then human are Net Negative and PPMs levels are slowly going down, the most powerful factor here, by a large margin, is the rate of emissions... because the planet's biosphere will still consume 40-60% of our emissions even as the climate changes some. If you don't get emissions down about 50% then of course it just keeps getting hotter regardless of how many trees you plant.

The real problem with trees is not that they rot, that still takes decades so the carbon is still offset for a couple decades even once the tree has died. That part is fine, the CO2 doesn't need to be stored away forever, the biosphere eating CO2 will do that far better than humans can.

Humans can boost CO2 sequestration by planting trees or maybe someday having robotic labor make CO2 sequestration machines, but those kind of ideas come in a distant second to first getting emissions down by at least 50% to kind of stop the bleeding, as they say. The Earth will still take a good 100-200 years or so to remove most of the emissions once we get well below 50% of our current emissions, but we could hopefully get the heat to stop rising in the next 50 years by focusing primarily on the top emissions sources of power plants and transport. Those are the cheapest/most effective things to upgrade first because they put out the most emissions AND do so with the lowest efficiency, around 60-80% of the fuel that goes into power plants or transport is just burned up into waste heat. Even nuclear has low efficiency because steam turbines kind of suck at converting heat into electric. 

Now of course solar and wind also technically how low efficiency too, but they are burning added fuel because of it since they get their fuel for free, but the point is that wasting all that fuel generally makes something significantly easier to replace. 

In the big picture replacing most fossil fuel is the easy part because most fossil fuel use wastes so much fuel at reasonably high costs. That's why solar panels and EVs can price compete so easily, because of the huge amounts of fuel that's doing no work and just going out the exhaust pipe. Direct heating is about the only thing fossil fuel does well and that's technically where it's harder to beat with renewables or cheaper than nuclear. A good example is industrial heating like industrial furnaces to heat metals and many other materials that need extreme heat for processing. That's a segment where renewables will be slower to be cost competitive because fossil fuels can hit decent efficiencies on just direct heating and no turbines or internal combustion engine to get in the way.

So after power plants and transport, industrial heating is one of the somewhat harder significant emissions sources to deal with. There is also sanitation and agriculture producing a good chunk of emissions and no significant solutions I've seen there other than minor tweaks and high science pipedreams, like everybody will just switch over to synthetic meat. Some might, but it will take many decades to get ppl to change eating habbits significantly and realistically either you need a replacement so cheap they can't say no or meat to get very expensive and force them to the alternative. Well once again to get the high adoption rates you really need to get cheaper than the high emissions products price, just like solar gets high adoption because it's cheap. Human behavior is kind of the biggest obstacle, but that's not unusual, the point if you can't just think of the science and engineering, you have to think about costs and human behavior. That's why getting costs down is so important because nothing on gods green earth motivates people more reliably than money.",1
"**No Atmospheric Loss:** Unlike Earth, space's lack of atmosphere means no energy is lost due to scattering or absorption.

* **Private vs. Public Efforts:** The U.S. relies more on private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, which prioritize other commercial ventures over SBSP.
* **Budget Constraints:** Competing priorities, such as defense spending, domestic programs, and other space exploration goals, often take precedence.

Imagine what could be achieved if the energy spent on political and societal divides were redirected toward innovation and collaboration!",1

Many of the right wings “they are letting them across the border” arguments are nothing more than appealing to the racism and bigotry of their supporters. (Notice no one is throwing a fit about Elon Musk who not only overstayed a student visa but then lied on his citizenship paperwork) 

Most of the “pro immigration” stands I have seen revolve more around “they are human beings stop treating them like cattle” and “we need a better system that is more responsive to our needs” especially what we will see if the incoming administration goes full mass deportation.

"I've found that Trump supporters are typically very happy to answer questions. The problem is that too often those answers are ignored by people who find it easier just to accuse them of the -ism of the week.

They may be backing the wrong horse, but that's not really their choice. By process of elimination, if there are two options, and one is actively ignoring anything you have to say, constantly belittling you, calling you racist (often in conversations where race isn't even a consideration) and Nazi, clearly that option isn't for you. 

Trump's first candidacy was about promising to bring jobs back, and appealing to people who felt that the government has sold them out. His victory should have been a wake up call that the working class was hurting. If Democrats had paid attention, and done some introspection, and, importantly listen to what trump supporters ACTUALLY SAID, then they would have responded with a platform like Franklin Roosevelt had back in the day and been able to pull people back to center, if not swing them left. 

Instead of listening though, all the name-calling began. In grade school we're taught that it's important not to attack those you plan to persuade. That's exactly what happened though. And the outcome, a second term, was by far the most predictable one. Instead of guiding people away from Trump, the other side matched by being just as repellant as he is. Most people want their concerns addressed in a logical, mature manner. If they can't have that, and EVERYONE is going to be a petulant child about it, they will choose the petulant child that doesn't clearly hate them. If everyone is going to lie, then they will believe nobody, but choose the one that is lying about somebody else over the one who lies about them. 

Watch as this gets down voted to oblivion, with comments that ignore the fact that I clearly called Trump a petulant child to accuse me of supporting him. I'll bet that despite calling it out in advance, it'll happen, because Trump's opposition is no more eager to accept a fact that challenges their world view than he is.

Now we're pretending we need Scooby-Doo and the gang to answer, ""why did all the people I've been accusing of Nazism and racism vote for the person that didn't accuse them of that? Why don't they believe people who were talking shit about them?""",1

"Okay, I'll try to refute some of what you say here;

First thing I'm going to say whatever pill a person is not permanent. A person can change pills at any point in time.

Red Pill &amp; Black Pill are not the same thing at all, and not even close to the same thing. As far as I know the Pill Logic there are 3 main pills, but then there are many sub pills such as the ""Dick Pill"" (which just means you go gay.) which I will not dive into. There are like 100 pills...

You come across as ""Blue Pilled"". The blue pilled individual tends to believe the main stream / Hollywood romcom narrative when it comes to dating. You can be a fat, awkward, nerdy guy, but eventually a beautiful woman will fall into your lap if you just stay yourself and be silly and humble while showing her you got a big heart. That's all it really takes. You don't need to be conventionally attractive or make a lot of money or be very tall. You just gotta be your quirky self, and let her know you heart is full of love, and then she is yours eventually after a series of silly events that finally bring you two together!

When it comes to your personal experience, or the Hollywood movie experience I'm going to label them as ""Results not typical."" It doesn't mean this can't happen. It just means these are not the typical results. You are the ""Under Dog"" on the dating market. Few women pick up the underdog as a pet and take it home. But, some do!

I believe that most blue pill men who are successful in dating are simply ""Attractive, but don't know it."" I bet you are not bald, and obese, and don't smell like shit. You probably take reasonably good care of yourself. You may not always hit the gym, but probably don't really need to all that much. Maybe you are tall, or got good genetics.

The next pill I'll explain is the ""Red Pill"". The Red Pill is the right mindset for most men to have. When it comes to dating. The Red Pill philosophy is basically stating the ""Blue Pill"" is either living in fantasy land or, just naturally born into wealth, privilege, and genetically well off, or just lottery winner levels of lucky. They don't need self improvement. They started at the top of the mountain with a free helicopter ride, and not the kind that certain dictators in south America offered to communists. An actual free helicopter ride.

The Red Pill at it's core is ""Self Improvement"". A red pill guy may say. ""I'm skinny, so I should start working out."" or ""I'm fat, so I need to exercise and lose some weight."". A red pill guy may say: ""I got a weak looking chin, but if I grow my beard out I'll look more manly and attractive."" The Red Pill believes they should put value on the table. And a man must work for that value. The red pill man will work hard on self improvement. He will think things like. ""I'm not gonna get a woman to go on a date with me if we take the bus. I have to be able to buy a car."" The red pill guy may think. ""If I'm ever in a situation with my girlfriend and we are out, and there is trouble / violence. I need to be able to defend myself. To be able to defend her."" So, he may take a martial arts lesson, or conceal carry a gun. The Red Pill philosophy is: ""If I work hard enough I can make it happen."" And this is true for most men... But then there is the black pills.

Black Pill = Doom &amp; Gloom Philosophy, it's basically ""I'm fucked no matter what I do! It's not worth putting in effort! The Juice is not worth the squeeze even if I could make it, which I can't!""

The black pill believes the whole system is very broken and rigged against them. They believe no amount of effort they put in will make things right for them. They believe they are doomed. They suffer from depression, and anxiety. They may have PTSD. They likely have serious mental health issues. They are a very broken person, and believe there is no way to put themself back together. They believe they never had a chance. They feel no matter what they do they will be too short, too ugly, too poor, too stupid to get a good woman. They also have a great amount of envy in others who are more successful. This often leads to many negative emotions and they often lash out. Not always violently, and usually not violently. But sometimes violently.

Being kindhearted / nice is a good thing. But, you need to put more on the table than that as a man. A man who only offers those things lands himself securely in the friend zone.

A man also needs a job, and to take care of himself, to be a good protector / provider. To become ""Prince Charming"".

One dark truth when it comes to getting sex is this:

A pimp / drug dealer / bad boy who is a tough guy and a real bad ass... Is gonna get more women than a weak shy nerdy guy who is very nice and not putting a lot else on the table. He will get friend zoned, and women will make mistake after mistake with the pimp / drug dealer. That is because the pimp / drug dealer / bad boy is a dominant and confident man. He may be toxic as fuck, but he knows how to fuck! It's the equivalent of when a guy likes to smash with a stripper / OF model, but would never put a ring on it.",1

Lets face it. We are stuck in a dynamic where women tend to get overwhelmed and thus are not putting the extra effort into approaching others but into selecting. This leaves men with the only option to put effort ind approaching while women still try to be approachable. Its a classic dynamic that reinforces itself. You need to be a patient dude if you focus on beeing approachable for women that are largly unable to approach you. (luckily there are at least 10% gems out there and i love them, because they take the extra burden to make it a change).

While you speak of 'quality of life', the OP is speaking of countries where people are being beaten or executed in the streets for political dissent. Nobody is arguing that we should be blind to our shortcomings and shouldn't strive to do better, but looking at the flaws that we do have that are, whether you choose to admit it or not, rather small on a global comparative scale, and declaring that America deserves to burn and die because of them, is incredibly naive, fatalistic, and stupid.

So its not enough to hire women, blacks or gays you have to find black women or lesbians or deaf gays.

Its a little funny.

That 30 percent Lesbian, deaf black, etc is also required for ""each type of worker on set"" which may be a group of worker that doesn't have a equal demographic break down.

"I agree with the take mostly.

There’s a study that suggests publicly sharing or talking about your goals may actually make you less inclined to achieve them as the validation you receive from being recognized by others gives a sense of completeness. Which I think makes sense. If you want to accomplish something hard, you’d likely only share it publicly if deep down you already believe you can achieve it. So if you can reap the rewards prior to actually taking action — maybe your family and friends really seem to believe in you and this reaffirms your own belief that you’re capable of achieving the thing — in a way, pursuing the thing is a bad idea because you’ve already gleaned much of the upside. 

I also think the Law of Attraction/manifesting stuff holds philosophically as a lot of it boils down to just subordinating oneself to the pursuit of an outcome. To use a tangible example, if you want to manifest going to a concert — you’d treat every event as a positive indicator in support of that directive. So, just like how getting a bonus at your job would be a sign from the universe that you need to buy the concert tickets — negative indicators, maybe getting into a car crash days before the concert and being tight on money would equally be a sign to attend the concert. Only you’d frame it from a lens of “wow being in this scary accident was a sign that life is short and I need to live in the moment. Forget what my bank account looks like I need to buy those tickets.” 

It’s not so much that it’s a lie or a delusion. It’s tautological to say that as long as you believe that something is destined to happen, nothing can happen to disprove that belief. And then I suppose a real manifester would be someone who is really good at ascribing this kind of meaning to events outside of their control. 

And hopefully there’s a bit of taking action on the things that are within their control in furtherance of their desired outcome and not just the mental gymnastics lol.

At least that’s my view on it. Similarly to the concept of synchronicity.",1

\* travel by foot and cycle where possible

\* use trains for reasonable distance travel

 \* talk to your friends about their climate-hostile choices instead of pointing fingers at billionaires exclusively

"Yes the warming globally does have an impact on how ENSO effects are expressed.

One of the issues is that the ENSO region is not warming as fast (or at all) as compared to the rest of the globe. This has the effect of amplifying the effects of La Nina and attenuating the effects of El Nino.

One metric that is has been developed to better assess the actual effects of the ENSO is the [RONI index](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/RONI.ascii.txt). Refer to \[[Oldenborgh et al. 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abe9ed)\] for the details of motivation behind the new RONI index.

If you read through [Berkeley Earth's Global Temperature Report for 2024](https://berkeleyearth.org/global-temperature-report-for-2024/) you'll see that they report the ENSO cycle relative to global background as opposed to the traditional way in which the ENSO cycles are only relative to the ENSO region. You'll see that despite the 2023 El Nino being strong via traditional indices like ONI it was actually only moderate in strength using global based metrics.

The implications here are that ENSO and its effects are not behaving like it used to.",1

"Almost all Christian church leaders are nothing more than conjecture generating machines to put it bluntly. It turns out that just about anyone can be a pastor, except for some denominations. But if some go to seminary, at the end of the day, the degree earned and the knowledge that they learn is up to some interpretation even for the most conservative denominations. In some cases there is zero oversight and zero accountability over what goes on in a church. For the churches that do have oversight and accountability, it still is not realistically even close to enough. 

Plus, most Christians in the world are politically right leaning, and primarily American Christians are Republican and conservatives--people who naively believe that global warming is a hoax and that the earth is flat. 

It wouldn't be a bad idea to get Christians to start teaching the legitimacy of the climate crisis and to encourage Christians to make a difference in the climate battle. I think that's a great idea. I just point out that the reason why it hasn't made much ground in churches is because it was taught early to them by evil oil company's back in the bush era that climate change was a hoax, and ever since they shoot it down whenever climate change us brought up, at least with most Christians it is that way anyway, and they don't even give it a chance.

There are a lot of facts that work against the main claims of climate change alarmists. Inconvenient truths, one might say. One is that IR leaving the surface is all absorbed by a GHG within a few tens of meters of the surface, and has been well before man began burning anything. IR returning from the top of the atmosphere has very little chance of reaching the planet’s surface without being absorbed by a GHG.

"Nuclear is stupidly expensive, inflexible, and very slow to build.   We are long past needing to slowly phase out fossil fuels.  We must now do it extremely rapidly.   

If you want to phase out fossil fuels rapidly, or at all, it is absolutely critical to look at cost.  To do this requires developing a full portfolio that can supply needs in all hours.    Except in the extremely far north, analysis after analysis shows that the most cost effective portfolios are 70% or 80% solar and wind, with a significant slug of storage.    The rest needs to be clean FLEXIBLE generation for which geothermal is a better fit but nuclear is a second option too. 

Flexible is critical because solar is by far the cheapest energy source out there.   When solar is cranking every other source needs to be OFF.  otherwise? You’re pushing cheap energy off the grid and replacing it with expensive electricity.   This, clean flexible needs to be viable running 40-50% of the time (this is why 90% capacity factors are bad and raise costs). 

This is just what the system engineers show and the way electricity markets work.   Basically, industry is building out renewables because AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, they’re cheaper and more effective",1

Cement is a problem, but if we get rid of fossil fuels entirely, what remains is basically cement and agriculture, and they go down below the level of roughly 22% of our present emissions that the IPCC estimates the biosphere will compensate entirely. I mean, I am all for replacing cement with better alternatives if it helps, but people still need to eat.

Now, agriculture's CH4 and NOx emissions as well as land use do influence the climate, but the animal husbandry share of that is grossly overestimated by things like falsely concluding that we could easily cut down plant production if we just did not have to feed all those animals. 

That is wrong, because we mostly feed animals leftovers from plants that we use for other purposes as well (meaning by not feeding animals we'd just throw calories and nutrients away that we'd have to replace with yet even MORE area for plants).",1

Our world is dying &amp; population is reaching its peak. We're essentially ripe for harvest. We're monitored by an advanced life form thats intertwined in our day to day lives, here and now. The covid vaccine was the beginning (research Grimes UFO album cover). 70% of the world took it. It had something in it similar to nanobots &amp; the advance life form is preparing to wipe the planet. Elites like Zuckerberg are aware, its why he is building a bunker.

These advanced life forms also control the moon. We have a second, larger ocean underneath the ocean floor. It seems as though the 70% of people who took the vaccine (and their offspring) will be harvested. The advanced life forms will back up the moon to cause biblical style flooding to eradicate the remaining 30%.

This has supposedly happened 8 times on earth already. Research the new findings on what they've discovered under the pyramids. 8 columns going 2 football fields in length downward into the ground. At the time the pyramids were built, an underground ocean supposedly existed around the height of the bottom of the columns. Either used to cool some kind of power mechanism or to allow immersible UAP the ability to enter or exit the structure.

(Almost) all politicians, scientists from all climate disciplines, the media and international big business are telling us in unison that we are destroying the global climate and that the world is on the brink of extinction.**

&gt; The IPCC’s CO2 hypothesis is scientifically untenable

&gt; The entire climate catastrophe construct of the IPCC and its representatives stands and falls with the assertion that the “greenhouse gas” CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere for a long time and thus endangers the earth’s thermal balance. This is why those responsible are trying to conceal the fact that considerable quantities of CO2 are permanently stored away as lime in the ocean through natural processes – for many millions of years. 

&gt; They are particularly embarrassed by the fact that these mechanisms have been taking place in the ocean for eons and that large quantities of CO2 are stored in rocks. There must therefore also be correspondingly large sources of CO2 replenishment in nature. This means that the IPCC’s entire CO2 cycle model collapses. 

&gt; This is probably the reason why oceanic calcification is not correctly represented in official and authoritative documents such as the IPCC report on “The Physical Science Base” or the Global Carbon Project. 

&gt; Also, Henry’s Law is not even mentioned in either of the publications cited here. This blatant suppression of essential scientifically proven facts is the Achilles heel of the entire green climate catastrophe ideology. In commercial terms, one could also speak of balance fraud.

"Yes, and the fossil record is an absolute graveyard of species that died off for reasons that had nothing to do with humanity.

But, claiming we’ve killed half the wildlife on the planet in the last 30 years?  That’s hyperbole and based on a flawed reading of the data.

https://ourworldindata.org/living-planet-index-decline

&gt;After the publication of the 2018 Living Planet Index report, researchers published a follow-up study in Nature where they looked at how the LPI was affected by extreme declines (or increases) in a small subset of the studied populations.4 For this study they looked at the results of the 2018 LPI report. It reported a 60% average decline in wildlife populations since 1970.5

&gt;By looking at the population data underlying the LPI they found that this 60% average decline was driven by extreme losses in a small subset of populations. If you excluded the 2.4% most-strongly declining populations – which was 356 out of 14,700 – the result reversed from a 60% average decline to a slightly positive growth. In other words, 2% to 3% of populations were doing extremely badly, but it appears that most species were doing okay.

"I mean I agree that Islamism is, you know, bad and stuff, but you have to take it in the broader context of the 20th century in the middle east. Islamism exists primarily because of the abject failure of secular nationalism to deliver on any of its promises in the region.

Like if we look at the states in the middle east outside of the oil-producing gulf countries (the gulf is kind of special because they can just buy loyalty, which obviates the need for ideology to some extent) there are two different kinds of government, both of which to some extent embraced secularism, and both of which failed. 

One direction was the vaguely socialist-influenced nationalist secularist direction: Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya... all of these countries were highly influenced by nationalist movements that promised that leaving religion behind and developing the nation-state in other directions would lead to prosperity and dignity for Arabs. Instead, these governments just all massively tripped over their own dick in one way or another, failing to deliver actual reform and prosperity, and instead using Israel as a scapegoat, which they then also failed to defeat. Gradually they all fell into fascism, with entrenched dictators using torture, secret police, and ethnic cleansing to maintain power. 

The other direction were the more conservative monarchies like in Jordan and pre-revolution Iran. These governments also failed in all of their promises of prosperity and development, and also used secret police and torture to maintain power. The only real difference is that they were/are backed by the US and UK, and being more conservative regimes they had/have slightly better relations with religion. 

This is where Islamism comes from: people were/are tired of being tortured and abused by regimes that continuously fuck up and fail at everything. They're tired of kings and dictators who use public money to enrich themselves while the people cannot afford bread. They're tired of war and ethnic cleansing. Islamism promises to solve these problems: instead of false democracy that leads to fascist dictatorship, it promises just and fair governance without corruption. Islamists have, by and large, not been in power in the region, and remain completely outlawed in many countries, and of the acts of war and mass killing repeatedly carried out in the region, the majority of them were carried out by secularists. 

Of course, that's not what actually did or would happen when Islamists get power, because, again Islamism is bad, actually. But I do kind of laugh at the idea of ""Islamism is ruining the middle east,"" because it's like, I don't know, have you seen it? Shit was kind of fucked already",0

"I think there's a lot we don't know about MH370, but some of the theories that make sense to me are more about covert operations and intelligence interests rather than anything supernatural or extraterrestrial.

First off, turning off the transponder and flying into a known radar blind spot isn't that hard for a trained crew. The route it took after losing contact suggests someone deliberately diverted it. The fact that it flew into the Indian Ocean (an area with strategic military bases and satellite coverage) makes me wonder if it was being monitored or tracked covertly.

The cargo is another interesting point. Officially, it was just electronics and fruit, but some of the chips onboard had patents filed just days before the flight. Maybe those devices contained proprietary tech or cryptographic hardware that certain powers wanted to get their hands on. If that's the case, it wouldn't be surprising if the plane was rerouted to a secure location where the cargo could be retrieved without public scrutiny.

Plus, the pilot had practiced routes into restricted or sensitive areas using flight simulators. Not necessarily proof of anything nefarious, but it raises questions. Was he testing boundaries? Or was he part of a plan? We don't know.

And then there's the satellite data. Even if the transponder was off, the aircraft's satellite pings continued for hours, which suggests someone or some system was still tracking it. It's possible that military or intelligence agencies had eyes on it, especially if the plane was carrying something valuable or sensitive.

Debris washing up on islands like Réunion has also raised eyebrows, some pieces don't match what we'd expect from a crash into the ocean, at least not in the timeline they've given. Witness reports from the Maldives saw a low-flying jet hours after contact was lost, which could mean it was redirected or transferred somewhere covertly.

So, I think it's plausible that MH370 wasn't just a tragedy but part of a covert operation, with the plane rerouted intentionally to avoid detection or to retrieve sensitive cargo. It's complex, and we may never have all the answers, but it seems more consistent with what we know about military and intelligence capabilities than some of the more wild theories.",1

"The only ""solution"" is to get ahead of it - either prevent it or prepare for it.  If you're counting on government intervention, don't hold your breath, unless AI becomes a threat to political offices.  Put career politicians' jobs at risk and see what happens.

The problem with preparing for it is at least twofold, probably more, but the easy to spot concerns are 1) knowing where the impact will be, when, and 2) availability of resources that will get individuals the skills needed.

What might help would be a realistic view of the areas affected (there's a lot of hype around what GenAI can do, and AGI is unlikely), and making AI available to aid in upskilling and avoiding long term unemployment without forcing everyone into mindless jobs/government servitude.

"Luckily, I don't think it's human nature to be this way. Lots of societies have had very long-term cultural perspectives, where they try very hard to consider how their choices will impact people many generations in the future.

Unfortunately, modern sociopolitical systems are really bad at doing this. Most of the economy is controlled by private actors who have zero incentive to work towards the common good, or to think far into the future. They have *every* incentive to only work on short-term gains, usually being legally required to maximize quarterly profits as their prime directive.

And, unfortunately, because these private actors have so much capital, they also have a lot of political capital and the government structures that *might* be able to get us out of this death spiral are largely owned and operated by those capitalists. Quite literally, in the case of the incoming president of the US.

It's not human nature though. I, personally, am deeply concerned about the kind of world future generations will inherit from us. Lots of us are, we just need sociopolitical restructuring to create a system capable of reflecting that concern.",1

"“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine that year for a story headlined “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery.” “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

“Well, first of all, you don’t know that,” Trump said about the allegations against Maxwell, who once dated Epstein.

Pres. Trump on Ghislaine Maxwell, longtime companion of infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein: ""I just wish her well, frankly.""

According to Wolff's new book ""Landslide""— his second detailing the Trump presidency — the former president's attention turned to Maxwell and her case as he looked for potential candidates for a presidential pardon, according to an extract published by the Times of London.

Of Maxwell, he asked ""Has she said anything about me?"" according to the book. Wolff reports that he added: ""Is she going to talk? Will she roll on anybody?""

Mariah Billado, Miss Teen Vermont 1997 told BuzzFeed, “I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here.'” Three other teenage contestants from the same year confirmed the story. 

Billado told BuzzFeed she mentioned the incident to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, who shrugged it off, saying, “Yeah, he does that.”

His position as the pageant’s owner entitled him to that kind of access, Trump explained, seemingly aware that what he was doing made the women uncomfortable. “You know, no men are anywhere. And I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I’m inspecting it… Is everyone OK? You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that,” he said.

""I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine although she does have a very nice figure. I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her.""

Trump appeared on the show (Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, 1984) alongside Maples, and proceeded to talk about 1-year-old Tiffany's physical characteristics.

“Well, I think she’s got a lot of Marla, she’s a really beautiful baby,” said Trump, who sat next to Maples. “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet, but time will tell,” Trump added, gesturing at his chest to indicate breasts.",1

"1st point: Fair.

2nd point: So did every developed country through their industrial development. They reason they can worry now is because they’re post-industrial economies who outsourced the manufacturing to these countries you mentioned. Just look at the energy consumption/capita of your developed countries. If everybody on Earth used as much energy as your average American or European we’d need 10 planets. 

3rd point: That is just wrong. Mostly rural populations simply have no means to impact their environment to the extent of urban sprawlings and industries. Yeah, some farmers killed some Hyenas in some farm. Compare the impact of that to the impact concrete has on the environment, to the impact construction leftovers has on the environment, to the impact urban expansion has in the natural habitat of these creatures.

And finally: Brazil.

Brazil’s energy production comes mostly from hydropower, Brazil’s preservation laws are light years ahead of European and American countries **in a moment where they still have native forests**. Farmers are literally forbidden of mowing down up to 80% of native forests within their properties.

"&gt; what effects can generate large temperature variations over hundreds of years

[How the Magnetic North Pole and Energetic Particle Precipitation Control Earth's Climate](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/8942/)

&gt; The hypothesis that the position of the magnetic North Pole (Dip Pole) (latitude) ought to be very highly correlated with global temperature change on Earth has been tested and shown to be correct. The probability of such a correlation happening by chance is close to zero. Moreover, this has likely been the dominant climate driver for the last 2000 years. 

&gt; A Granger causality test shows Pole Shift drives temperature the latter having up to a two-year lag (Figure1). Two new climate models with and without CO₂ are developed and tested. Both models successfully predict modern warming, the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), and the Roman Warm Period (RWP) in time (figures 3+4). The model excluding CO₂ (figure 4) predicts past warming with stronger amplitude. This model also predicts the Little Ice Age ( LIA) with a seamless transition into the Modern Warm Period using the real data sets (figure 5). 

&gt; As Pole swings Northwards, interacting region shifts to higher ionospheric altitudes and combined particle precipitation changes (EEP) reduce albedo, hence increase forcing (figure 2) by virtue of their changes to the world’s clouds, provide calculated values in the region of 81% of recent warming, with the rest (15%) mainly of solar origin. CO₂ at most could contribute 3.9% of all warming.",1

"Well actually for total renewables we're #2 in the world. 

As much as Trump is screwing things up our #1 problem is actually long haul lines in the US which can take a decade to get approval for. This is critical because large scale renewables are generally a long distance from where the power is needed. 

So funny enough if we had a better grid the projects approved for build on the books today could easily meet the power needs for most of the US. 

Also batteries won't stop. They are a simple arbitrage play for investors and don't face much regulation. So we will build out 1/3 of the solution under Trump. No matter what. 

Oh and the three legs of renewables to get it done are. 

1. Production (solar, wind, etc)
2. Distribution (grid upgrades, long haul, etc)
3. Storage (batteries, water, air, gravity, etc)",1

"&gt;Islam is an Arab imperialist ideology that kills native cultures and Arabizes them.

As many other comments have already pointed out, only 20% of muslims are Arab. 

[Why was North Africa more Arabized than other regions conquered by the early caliphates? : r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vrkpu9/why_was_north_africa_more_arabized_than_other/) does a really good job of explaining why Arabization occured; 

TLDR; the Caliphate has historically been an empire of Arabs, so similar to Latin the Arab language was spread because it was the imperial language. There are Arabs who insist that their language is heavenly or something but most Muslims you ask will agree that's completely BS. The Qur'an is in Arabic because Muhummad was Arab, there's no other reason for it. 

Furthermore the Turkic and Indian worlds haven't bee Arabized at all, but rather Persianized, since the Iranians accepted Islam and spread it while continuing to keep their culture intact. The Turks and Indians sadly did not get the memo and assumed Persian culture was Islam and prestigious. (just like Arabic supposedly is according to you)

&gt;\-You need to be a descendants of Qurayshi Arabs to be a Caliphate

No, you don't. A quick google search will tell you otherwise. There's no theological basis for this unless you're Shia: the Caliph has to be someone elected who is extremely knowledgeable in Islam. Historically, this hasn't happened since the first Caliphate collapsed less than 100 years after Muhummad died, and every Caliphate since then has been a monarchy. (not Islamic!!!) EVERY historical Caliphate after the first one is illegitimate. 

&gt;Islam is heavily Arab centric

Damn you have quite a few points, let me refute all of them:

* The pilgrimage is only required if you have the luxury for it. Most muslims (including myself) aren't rich enough to go and likely never will be. 
* The only reason those Arabs are 'idolized' (though they really shouldn't be this revered) is because they were pious and close friends of the Prophet, meaning their decisions help us interpret the Qur'an. 
* You have two choices of calendar: Arab or Latin. I'm not sure why following the Arab one is a bad thing. 
* How does praying in a certain direction Arabize people?
* I think this has less to do with Arabization and more, you can only stylize head coverings in so many ways. For instance Bengalis wear Sarees, but when used to cover the hair it just looks like a hijab. 
* The naming situation is not a problem of the religion but rather people overcorrecting to be more Islamic. (iirc a result of Saudi Arabia's sect of Islam telling everyone else they're wrong) This can be solved by increasing education, a lot easier than telling 1 Billion people their religion is fake.",0

"You have no idea the extent of what is happening in the Middle East, do you?

Israel is engaged in military operations against Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and targets in Syria while also facing direct tensions with Iran after Tehran’s missile attacks on Israel earlier this year. The U.S. is actively bombing Houthi positions in Yemen, responding to their attacks on Red Sea shipping, and has bolstered its military presence with warships and submarines in the region amid escalating threats from Iran and its proxies.

We don't need to Bomb Iran. We bombed Houthis, who are theirs. Iran’s military, while not invincible, is robust, with a network of proxies (Hezbollah, Houthis, Iraqi militias) ready to retaliate across the region. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected direct talks with Washington while signaling readiness for retaliation for the attack on Houthis. 

The rise for Houthis has tangled the Middle East further. Saudi Arabia sees them as an Iranian dagger at its border; the U.S. labels them terrorists (a designation toggled on and off for diplomatic reasons); and their Red Sea campaign has jacked up global shipping costs, with firms rerouting around Africa. They’re a wildcard—defiant, battle-hardened, and plugged into Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” making them a small but outsized player in the region’s chaos. 

The Houthis control about a third of Yemen, including Sanaa and the strategic Hodeida port, ruling through a mix of tribal alliances and brutal crackdowns. They’ve turned schools into indoctrination hubs and taxed aid to fund their war machine.

Syria is a mess after the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in late 2024, ending a decades-long dictatorship. Rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), toppled the government, and now a transitional authority under HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and caretaker PM Mohammed al-Bashir is trying to hold things together until at least mid-2025. But the country’s fractured—Islamist factions, remnants of Assad’s forces, and Kurdish groups like the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are all vying for control.

Iran-backed militias, grouped under the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), and U.S. troops. Since October 2023, these militias have launched over 200 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, ramping up after Gaza flared. In 2025, the pace hasn’t slowed—drones and rockets hit American outposts weekly, with a January attack in Jordan killing three U.S. soldiers and wounding 40 as a stark escalation.

Syria’s in flux—but the region’s death toll likely tops 60,000 for 2025 already, with millions displaced. It’s a web of wars, each feeding the others, and no clear off-ramp exists, and that just the tip of the iceburg",0

"First; I'm not necessarily a Christian. The problem with most Reddit atheists is that they subscribe to a pop culture, superficial view of Christianity that doesn't even truly exist. Then they use that as the basis to assume there is and can be no God. You're starting with a false premise and making a judgement based on that. There are multitudes of different interpretations of Christianity. I think it's best to look into information from religious scholars they are both Christian and non Christian before you draw any final conclusions. There are many different descriptions of hell in the Bible that range to the description of a quite literal contemporary garbage dump that was perpetually of fire out side of Israel to simple non-existence. There are many Christians that believe the atheist notion that you live and die and that's it, is what happens to non Christians. Eternal torment in fire is not an absolute belief for all Christians. Some people take the Bible literally which is the superficial and shallow understanding. Other people realize that the Bible is filled with allegory and cultural and historical context that requires consideration to people grasp the message of the content. 

Personally I like the secular Gnostic take. God is simply pure consciousness he/it exists in a larger reality that goes beyond spacetime and is a concept incomprehensible to humanity. Just like the Internet is an incomprehensible concept to a dog. From there you have the Gnostic Aeons that are basically siloed ""split personalities from pure consciousness. You could also consider them simulations within the ultimate simulation. From there you have more Aeons and further ""simulations"" within that which ultimately lead to our physical reality. We are essentially a split personality of a split personality, of a split personality, of a split personality, of pure consciousness. If you look into the work being done in the ""theory of everything"" thought space you'll see there are many academics postulating about the nature of reality. Many of them arrive at a similar conclusion that is, reality may exist behind spacetime and consciousness may be inherent rather than emergent.",0

"Why would you ever want to turn it off? You can scale production, and extra capacity is a positive thing. Additionally, we’re assuming that improvements in renewables will eventually allow them to be an effective primary power source but I don’t see any evidence that’s currently the case.

It’s not about cost efficiency, or it shouldn’t be anyway. It’s about the best option, and nuclear is the best option. It’s capable of handling vastly increased power demands, it’s incredibly reliable, and it doesn’t rely on the hope that batteries will be effective and that advancements in technology will let it be effective. We have it now.

Even if it’s more expensive, it’s the better choice.

~~Edit: I actually have a better argument here, though I didn’t think of it right away. Some back of the napkin math indicates that a solar farm to equal the amount of power produced by the proposed nuclear plan, which is apparently insufficient according to a reply, would be 755 square miles, generously. A monstrously Herculean task, which won’t even give you the amount of power you want, and will be enormously expensive.~~

Edit 2: I used the wrong units in that math, the actual answer is closer to thirty square miles. It’s still an insane task, but well within the realm of possibility. I still maintain nuclear is the right answer though. Why build thirty square miles of solar farms, hoping we’ll develop battery technologies to make it workable, when you could build ONE nuclear plant.",1

This includes equipment and weapons supplied through Presidential Drawdown Authority and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. To the extent that aid was structured as loans, the intent was to have them repaid through interest from immobilised Russian assets.

Technically you're right but functionally it doesn't matter - Trump is jealous of the IMF and European loans and is intent on getting something of value for the vast amount of money the US gifted to Ukraine, and if he doesn't get something he's not going to give them anything else, loan or not.  

So they have a choice, pay the debt he imagines is owed, or fight without US support.  Given that they can't win even with US support, going without it is obviously not going to work out well for the Ukrainian government.  

They do have other options, like making a deal with Russia and giving the US the finger, but I don't think Zelensky could do that even if he wanted to, I think his own people would execute him for getting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians killed just to get a worse deal from the Russians than he could have had with zero casualties at the start.",0

"I just had chatGPT o1 replace the solar example with Danish offshore wind.

So keep that in mind, it might not be using completely accurate numbers.

Below is a similar lifetime cost comparison—this time using Danish offshore wind in place of German solar—and comparing it to Finland’s Olkiluoto 3 (OL3) nuclear plant. The format mirrors the original solar-vs.-nuclear breakdown, but with updated estimates reflecting offshore wind’s capital costs, capacity factor, lifetime, and required infrastructure.

---

## Denmark (Offshore Wind)

### 1. Base Cost
- Approx. €3.5 billion per GW installed.
  Modern offshore wind farms can be lower or higher depending on site depth, turbine size, and local supply chains, but €3.5B/GW provides a reasonable ballpark.

### 2. Capacity Factor
- ~50% for a high-performing offshore wind farm.
  Offshore wind often achieves capacity factors in the 40–50% range, especially in the North Sea. Denmark’s windy coastal locations help push it toward the upper end of that range.

### 3. Lifetime
- 30 years (typical design life for modern offshore turbines).
  Some developers claim up to 35 years, but 25–30 years is more conventional before major refurbishments.

### 4. Infrastructure &amp; Transmission
- €1.0 billion per GW for offshore transmission cables, substations, and grid upgrades.
  Offshore wind requires significant underwater cable and substation infrastructure to bring power to shore.
- Total Upfront Cost = €3.5B (turbines) + €1.0B (offshore grid) = €4.5 billion per GW.

### 5. Annual Maintenance
- €70 million per GW per year (about 1–2% of the total installation cost).
  Offshore O&amp;M (operations and maintenance) can be relatively high due to boat/helicopter access, harsh marine environments, and specialized equipment.

---

## Finland (OL3 Nuclear)
(Same figures as in the original comparison for consistency.)

- Base Cost: ~€9.375 billion per GW installed
- Capacity Factor: ~90%
- Lifetime: 60 years
- Annual Maintenance: ~€250 million per GW

---

## Annual Energy Output (per GW)

**Offshore Wind (Denmark):**  
1 GW * 50% * 8,760 hours = 4.38 TWh/year

**Nuclear (OL3, Finland):**  
1 GW * 90% * 8,760 hours = 7.884 TWh/year

---

## Lifetime Energy Output (per GW)

**Offshore Wind (30 years):**  
4.38 TWh/year * 30 = 131.4 TWh

**Nuclear (60 years):**  
7.884 TWh/year * 60 = 473.04 TWh

---

## Cost per TWh (Including Grid Connection)

**Offshore Wind:**  
4.5 billion EUR / 131.4 TWh ≈ 34.3 million EUR/TWh

**Nuclear:**  
9.375 billion EUR / 473.04 TWh ≈ 19.8 million EUR/TWh

---

## Annual Maintenance Cost per TWh

**Offshore Wind:**  
70 million EUR/year / 4.38 TWh/year ≈ 16.0 million EUR/TWh

**Nuclear:**  
250 million EUR/year / 7.884 TWh/year ≈ 31.9 million EUR/TWh

---

## Key Observations

1. **Upfront Cost per TWh**
   - Offshore Wind: ~€34 million/TWh
   - Nuclear (OL3): ~€20 million/TWh

   Despite a lower total capital outlay for a single GW of offshore wind, its lifetime energy output is significantly smaller due to a lower capacity factor and a shorter lifetime, resulting in a higher cost per TWh compared to OL3 nuclear.

2. **Maintenance**
   - Offshore wind’s annual maintenance per TWh is about half that of nuclear (roughly €16M vs. €32M per TWh). However, total cost of generation is still higher for wind, driven by its lower lifetime output.

3. **Variability and Grid Support**
   - Offshore Wind is intermittent, albeit more stable than onshore wind or solar. It may need complementary balancing resources like interconnectors (e.g., Denmark–Norway HVDC) or energy storage.
   - Nuclear provides continuous baseload power and requires no intermittent backup, but carries higher annual maintenance obligations.

4. **Overall Cost-Effectiveness**
   - For each TWh delivered over its lifetime, OL3 nuclear remains less expensive than offshore wind.
   - Offshore wind, however, can be deployed faster (in smaller increments) and avoids some political and safety concerns associated with nuclear.

---

## Conclusion

Using Denmark’s offshore wind example (with a 50% capacity factor and 30-year lifetime) and comparing it to Finland’s new OL3 nuclear plant suggests that OL3 nuclear delivers electricity at a lower cost per TWh once you factor in total lifetime output. Offshore wind is certainly less expensive than German solar (on a per-kWh basis in northern climates) and has become a strong renewable contender, but on a purely lifetime cost-per-TWh metric, OL3 nuclear remains cheaper—much like in the earlier solar vs. nuclear comparison.

In Denmark’s case, the robust North Sea winds partially offset the intermittency and help reduce storage needs by leveraging interconnectors with hydropower-rich neighbors. Nonetheless, from a straight cost/TWh perspective, the Finnish OL3 plant still has the edge.",1

"*Me trying to explain for the millionth time that small nuclear reactors aren’t supposed to be used in mainline power plants, they’re supposed to be used in large vehicles, and the engineers saying otherwise are just saying that so they don’t get shot by the oil execs:*

But seriously, small nuclear reactors would do wonders for pollution if stuck in cargo ships and the like, aka some of the most polluting things around after fossil fuel power plants. Electricity just isn’t practical for vehicles that big, not to mention recharging them would be a logistical *nightmare*, and traditional engines will pollute the fuck out of that area.

Additionally, while still mostly theoretical, they can be used to power large aircraft, which could greatly decrease or even effectively eliminate the carbon cost of air travel. Same goes for long-distance trains, though in that case electricity is viable and it’d really only become relevant for trans-continental rail lines that go through severely underpopulated or even uninhabited regions, aka regions without many power plants running that can have their power syphoned to a large train.

They’d also be helpful for space colonization, not generally as long-term solutions, but great for keeping things online until the solar farms and batteries are at the point running isn’t a concern, even in emergencies. Additionally, in a theoretical ship designed to travel between solar systems, they’d be utterly required to have any chance of success.

"

Again you keep throwing out straw man arguments and twisting my words. 


Nobody said global. Storms on average aren't so large you would need more than 100 or so miles of energy grid. This is just silly that you assert such an obviously maximalist statement like global energy grids. It's just ludicrously beyond even what I was talking about and points at your dishonesty in this conversation


It's almost comical how instead of asking me to clarify, even, you just assume things and go to extremes.

That's not true at all.

There's geothermal plants producing over 6000 GWH of electricity. 

And the point of solar isn't really grid scale, it's covering roofs, and parking lots and roads and other empty unused space. It can help a lot with cooling and engineering deserts too. It's building out a lot of total capacity, far beyond our actual needs, and capturing that energy and storing it at all possible times. Energy storage is currently much cheaper than energy generation anyway.

I literally DIY'ed my own home battery system from batteries I got off eBay. I made 300kwh for ~$280

And the velocity doesn't really make a huge variable.

Again, it's not either or and nothing in life will ever be either or. We can easily do both. Nobody is going to say ok we as a planet will do absolutely zero renewables and only focus on nuclear. There's tons of companies and enterprising individuals getting loans for all types of electricity and that isn't going to change.

Heck, I'm in favor of nukes, but the ludicrous idea of console wars applied to something that isn't even an either or kind of thing is funny to me.

In our experience, the best conversations genuinely consider the other person’s perspective. Here are some techniques for keeping yourself honest:

- Instead of only looking for flaws in a comment, be sure to engage with the commenters’ strongest arguments — not just their weakest.
- Steelman rather than strawman. When summarizing someone’s points, look for the most reasonable interpretation of their words.
- Avoid moving the goalposts. Reread the claims in your OP or first comments and if you need to change to a new set of claims to continue arguing for your position, you might want to consider acknowledging the change in view with a [delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=changemyview&amp;utm_content=t5_2w2s8) before proceeding.

"&gt; **Key point:** Calling MAGA extremists “not Christian” turns a real-world problem into a label debate—a classic *purity test*.  
&gt; Here’s why that framing matters, and why sticking to actions is more honest and useful.

### Why the “not-Christian” angle misses the mark  

1. **Shifts focus away from responsibility**  
   *If harm is blamed on outsiders, church communities feel less urgency to examine their own teachings, leaders, and silence that enabled it.*

2. **Lets abuse hide behind semantics**  
   Each time cruelty appears, the label simply gets revoked—so the group stays “pure” by definition while the victims stay hurt.

3. **Overlooks Christianity’s mixed record**  
   The same Bible has fueled abolitionists **and** slave-holders; soup kitchens **and** inquisitions. Which passages and power structures Christians elevate is what shapes outcomes, not the badge itself.  

___
### Bottom line  

*   Whether MAGA believers pass a theological checklist is irrelevant.  
*   What matters is holding Christians—and their institutions—accountable for the fascist politics being pushed **in the name of their faith**.",0

"I read this book (which is a must read and easy enough for anyone to understand) but the review is from an Amazon reviewer who is highly rated. The book includes graphs and maps. 

On the Move by Abrahm Lustgarten is a welcome addition to the growing library of what humans face in regard to the world’s changing climate conditions. On the Move is more of a sociological treatise on why people are moving/migrating, and where are their destinations. The three main vectors Lustgarten projects for the impetus of migration are: heat/drought/water crisis, and crop failure; heat and resulting fires; flooding, due to rising sea levels, tides and storms, in particular tropical storms/hurricanes.

Lustgarten selects Central America and California as his initial targets. Simply put, Central Americans are abandoning their farms as drought has rendered their fields barren. Hunger is a great motivation for moving, and the author provides a few examples citing individual journeys, as well as the perils of large groups moving toward the US border through Mexico. Mexico is caught between a rock and a hard place with migrants pouring in while the United States is critical about the migrants working their way to the Mexico-US border. In California, increasing heat and dryness fans wildfires that threaten or destroy entire communities. The Eden that once was is going up in smoke. Additionally, the Colorado River serves an enormous population in the southwestern United States, as well as industrial agriculture. The demands upon the water provided by the Colorado River are reaching a tipping point, in particular, if snows in the Rocky Mountains are not significant enough. If it’s decided agriculture wins, what happens to the people.

Lustgarten transitions to the southern states, Louisiana in particular. Flooding from sea level rise, storm surges, uninsurable properties disproportionately affecting the poor, and to compound the issue, from Louisiana and all other southern states in this same boat, the wealthy are able to move, whereas the poor cannot afford to do so. Urban areas such as Atlanta are expecting major population increases, but lack the infrastructure to accept the coming flood of people. In both California and southern states bordering the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, commercial insurance companies want to bail out. States have taken over in some instances, in order to keep people in place, even if calamities are recurrent. People vote.  
  
So where is everybody going to go? Lustgarten strongly hints that a second migration is nearly upon us, where heat, fire, and lack of water will drive people from the western sunbelt, and heat and too much water will drive people back to the “Rust Belt”. Temperatures will remain moderate, and the Great Lakes combined contain about 25% of the world’s fresh water. Duluth, Minnesota in particular ans an “Climate Oasis” along with Detroit, Michigan could easily absorb many migrants from climate extremes, but does an infrastructure exist to accommodate the possible coming hordes. Is the government lax in preparing, or might preparing spawn panic? How will migrants within the United States be received? As heat continues to have effect on water supply and living conditions, will there be a further stratification of society, in particular between the haves and have nots? Will air conditioning be available to all, or be unaffordable to many?",1

"!delta I want to give you a delta because you touched on a topic that wasn't mentioned, which is their administration. Short-range means smaller missile which means that the bomb isn't put in a silo, but a truck or a plane. These are much harder to hide, much more obvious (cause you have to move them around, a silo is hidden forever) and much easier targets.

So, for these small nukes to become mainstream useable by smaller countries, they'd have to advance either technology or infrastructure to combat the rapidly advancing technologies in drones, precise strikes, AA, etc. Since I cannot make a valid opinion over whether the advancements will come soon or not (I'm not some military or MilComplex guru), I won't stand by an opinion that relies on it.

The West is ramping up this sector since terrorist and terrorist states have drones and advanced weaponry now, but how far away this kind of tech (whatever it may be e.g. Directed EMPs, planes equipped with electromagnets, etc.) is anyone's guess, and for it to be cheap enough to become used worldwide is even longer. Also, the target point is valid; would the West risk nukes in the ME even if Iran produces one? The risk that a different group would be able to capture (or destroy) a much stronger US bomb is non-zero, which is enough to re-consider active deployment in warzones.

The defense of US homeland is not contingent on if they have smaller strategic nukes in the ME or not, even if Iran or the Taliban acquires one. Its contingent on countermeasures such as intelligence, missile interceptors, precise strikes on infrastructure etc. The Taliban or IRGC do not care about their people, so the fear of retaliatory strikes really won't stop them.

Since my point is based on the idea that nukes have to be fought with nukes, if Iran (I use it as an example, but it goes for any state with similar intentions) uses one on a military target and the West successfully retaliates without the use of nukes, it would actually reinforce the current no-nuke worldview. People would call for their use at first, but when they calm down they see things more clearly and see that there are less risky solutions available.",0

"Abstract:

""Carbon markets play an important role in firms’ and governments’ climate strategies. Carbon crediting mechanisms allow project developers to earn carbon credits through mitigation projects. Several studies have raised concerns about environmental integrity, though a systematic evaluation is missing. We synthesized studies relying on experimental or rigorous observational methods, covering 14 studies on 2346 carbon mitigation projects and 51 studies investigating similar field interventions implemented without issuing carbon credits. The analysis covers one-fifth of the credit volume issued to date, almost 1 billion tons of CO2e. We estimate that less than 16% of the carbon credits issued to the investigated projects constitute real emission reductions, with 11% for cookstoves, 16% for SF6 destruction, 25% for avoided deforestation, 68% for HFC-23 abatement, and no statistically significant emission reductions from wind power and improved forest management projects. Carbon crediting mechanisms need to be reformed fundamentally to meaningfully contribute to climate change mitigation.""",1

"Yin -AND- Yang. Both.

I highly recommend you read or listen to \[The Kybalion\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL43l2SFVWQ&amp;t=1s). You don't need to agree with or believe in everything in it but understand that this is a good framework of what the global elite believe. 

There must be an equal balance of good and evil. In order for you to be a good person and do good things there must be an equal amount of bad being done either by you or someone else. But good and bad are relative to each other and the lines between the two are very blurry. 

You have a goal in life but there will be an equal amount of push back when you move in the direction of achieving those goals. This is not evil. It's an indifferent Nature. 

One thing that the elites believe is that mind is equal to the physical world. One thing that the majority of the most powerful people in the world know and practice - whether they are perceived as good or bad - is that if you want a thing you have two choices: push against everything that stands in the way between you and your goal and give it your all to attain that thing. This is difficult and it does work. Sometimes. It's what they teach us.

But they believe in the other method. Instead of fighting against obstacles, just view your goal in a way that there are no obstacles. Or at least the least amount of obstacles. And those obstacles that remain, dissolve them with your mind. It probably sounds absurd to you now but you're right in saying that reality is a simulation. When you're ready you can be shown what can only be considered ""magic"". But remember - there was a time where a remote controlled car would be considered magic but now we just see it as a toy.

When you're ready to test the boundaries of reality do the Neville Goddard Ladder Experiment. You have one chance to do it right so don't do it if you're not ready.  

The secret of life and the simulation we live in was already told to you in the form of a song:

"You know the space is factored into renewable cost?

A recent study found that nuclear power needs to come down 85% in cost to be competitive with renewables when looking into total system costs for a fully decarbonized grid, due to both options requiring flexibility to meet the grid load.

&gt; The study finds that investments in flexibility in the electricity supply are needed in both systems due to the constant production pattern of nuclear and the variability of renewable energy sources. However, the scenario with high nuclear implementation is 1.2 billion EUR more expensive annually compared to a scenario only based on renewables, with all systems completely balancing supply and demand across all energy sectors in every hour. For nuclear power to be cost competitive with renewables an investment cost of 1.55 MEUR/MW must be achieved, which is substantially below any cost projection for nuclear power.

London councils do have scrutiny committees that oversee housing allocations, emergency provision and provide transport for those who have no means and wish to return home. Most urban councils will have arranged a flight back to country of origin for someone at some point. 

Scrapping the committee doesn't mean the work won't be done, it means it won't be scrutinized. If I were a climate change officer there I'd be delighted. Instead of having to go in front of hostile councillors every month, Reform have just removed their oversight of me. Great job lads!",0

Climate change is serious and therefore deserves to be one of the primary reasons we should bring up in the discussion of transitioning to renewables. Making us more energy independent is also very important and should be a primary reason as well as to transitioning to clean energy.

We should embrace both the climate change point and the energy independence point as equally vital and primary and not relegate one to being secondarily important.

We by all means should still bring climate change up very much however we should likewise complement it with energy independence because climate scepticism needs to be worked against in all sectors whilst at the same time we should raise the benefits it has to our geopolitical position.",1
"Electric Vehicles will now be able to go from zero battery power to an 80 per cent charge thanks to Researchers at the University of Waterloo who made a breakthrough in lithium-ion battery design to enable this extremely fast charging. 15 minutes is much faster than the current industry standard of nearly an hour, even at fast-charging stations.

Batteries made using this new design are also able to withstand more charges – up to 800 cycles, a feat not possible with current EV batteries.

“We need to make EVs more affordable and accessible, not just for the wealthy,” said Yverick Rangom a professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering. “If we can make batteries smaller, charge faster, and last longer, we reduce the overall cost of the vehicle. That makes EVs a viable option for more people, including those who don’t have home charging stations or who live in apartments. It would also increase the value of second-hand EVs, making electric transportation more accessible.”

This new design will help drivers avoid “range anxiety” - the worry about driving long distances without access to charging stations. It will also address another major barrier in the market: the reliability of used EVs. By showing a tremendous increase in any one battery’s ability to withstand up to 800 charges, this technology will address the mystery around the state of battery health for second-hand buyers

"Reflecting (or scattering) light away is just reflecting light.  

A splotch of white paint scatters visible light back into space.  That is slightly less effective than blocking light before it gets to Earth.  However, the objects at L5 are making a shadow (penumbra) larger than Earth.  Most of the shade effect is wasted.  But just for “order of magnitude estimate” ignore both.  

In space you can use thin material.  However, it has to hold position so then thinner material has to be further away from the Lagrange point and casts a wider shadow which is even less focused toward Earth.  On Earth the material has to be thick enough to survive in our atmosphere.  Now we just need to compare the price tags.  The effect is proportional to the surface area.  

The 1% surface area is proportional for both reflection options.  Mirror balloons over the ocean require the same size as mirrors in space.  Yes, Earth is huge.  So launching mirrors costs $trillions.  

I’ll tell you why you have not heard of deploying solar radiation as reflective balloons.  Any billionaire who can afford a yacht has the resources to easily go install a small example.  There is no new technology needed, only the will to take action.  The space industry wants to do many things in space.  To get there they need launch systems (probably rockets).  They do *not* have any intention of mitigating climate change.  Well at least not this century.  In the very long term space industry could do a great number of huge projects.  For now they just want public support for space development.  

Sorry, I write in science fiction reddits so much that I forgot “mass driver” was an unfamiliar term.  If you are interested: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTram. By the time we have invested enough money in space launches to block 1% of sunlight we can easily talk about projects that are $10 of billions because the total price goes down.  We can also talk about just colonizing space and building the mirrors there.  We can also talk about scrapping that and just dropping calcium down from Luna and scattering it in the lower stratosphere like a meteor strike.  With only slight modification the same Lunar base can launch payloads that almost reach the ground before disintegrating and going fireball.  It is like tactical nukes but without neutrons or radioactive fallout.  

If we are doing the sunshade in space capability then it has to be capable of coating large portions of Earth itself too.    The military did a study of space based penetrators called “Project Thor” or “Rods from God”:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment.

Because you are making stuff up? If you claim that coal+gas compensated for the decline in nuclear power, you'd expect an according increase in their shares. Yet, nuclear made up 29.81% of the German electricity mix in 2000 before the decision to phase it out was taken in 2001. At that point in time coal+gas provided for 60.8% of the electricity. 2024 was the first full calendar year without nuclear power in the mix, and coal+gas made up 38.48% of the electricity mix.

"There is powerful dogma because this topic isn’t taught in U.S. schools. 

Russia and China now protect private wealth and no longer have planned economies. 

Russia adopted communism during the 1920s. China during the 1950s. Russia robbed business owners when adopting communism. China paid business owners to buy companies and many wealthy Chinese went to Taiwan with that money. Chinese that didn’t flee to Taiwan became politicians. 

The Bolshevik Revolution happened because Tzar Nicolas caused famine among workers. The Chinese revolution happened because population expansion began causing famine.

Communism was the correct solution for both problems at the time, but things have changed. 

Both countries were started by labor movement leaders.

Russia has been an OPEC country since the Bolshevik revolution. 

China has limited oil, so solar is its main pathway to economic development. Solar just happens to be the next economic boom and China invested heavily.

Russia and China adopted capitalist economies during the 1990s.

"Anything worth doing, is worth doing properly. There are use-cases or AI, but most things would be improved by not using it. 

Could your time prompting an AI for what you want stand in the way of being better at picking stock images or a library of references?

AI is a crutch, it's not bad to use it but there's a good argument against using it for most anything you care much about.

https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-deadly-rise-of-scientism

&gt;The scientific process is one of the greatest tools humanity has created to separate fact from fiction.  Because of the remarkable societal advancements science has created, our society in turn has placed a deep trust science.


&gt;This trust has incentivized bad actors to usurp the scientific process so that they can claim whatever “truth” benefits their interests is the truth.

&gt;This coup has been accomplished by transforming science (the open debate of all existing data) into scientism (a religion where you are expected to unquestionably trust the pronouncements of the anointed “scientific experts”).

&gt;Peter Hotez and Anthony Fauci have played a pivotal roles in enshrining scientism throughout our society.  In this article, we will review just how they did that, the profound consequences of their actions and exactly what happens once no one can debate the science.

"In addition to pre-post observations on a group of students, you would also need a control group: multiple observations of similar students who choose not to go to college. It is possible all kids become more left-leaning when they leave home for instance. 


My prior is you would actually find such an effect - but it could be to any number of reasons: 


1) College improves your earning prospects. Kids with brighter futures probably are more pro-social. 


2) College introduces you to new perspectives and types of people. This is not good for conservativism. 


3) There is an urban causal effect too. Cities are incredibly left leaning, and most universities are in cities (or college towns). Hard to blame the influence of only the professors if the whole city is very left wing. 


It is possible the selection of courses students can take pushes them to the left. But I think this question is better evaluated on a subject by subject basis rather than university as a whole. ",1

"I think others have done a great job of listing Biden's many achievements. I personally think he was a very productive president, and surprisingly progressive for how divided the country has been and how MAGA-poisoned the well has become.

  
But I want to propose a different angle: The left is not really in a state where it can acknowledge victories, even when they are happening.

I am not sure why this happens necessarily, but the right does not have this issue. They are lockstep behind their figurehead, and there is little to none dissent. No republican commentator, pundit, media personality, or politician can meaningfully stand up to Trump or criticize him in any real way without being instantly shunned by the whole movement. So when they vote, they all vote, and when decisions are made (however stupid or insane) they stand unquestioningly behind it.

This is madness I believe. But the left is also mad in a way, because however imperfect Biden or Kamala are, they are qualified serious people with the capacity for leadership. I may not agree with EVERYTHING they do, but knowing that the alternative is Trump, the left should be unified in supporting them. Instead, we repeatedly see them held to an entirely different standard. Kamala was criticized mercilessly during the campaign, a lot of times from the left.

A good example is her less-than-good take on Israel-Palestine. She may still be orders of magnitude better than Trump both in her take, and her ability to deal with such a complicated issue, and yet, somehow so many lefties decided to stay home and now we are stuck with this idiot for another for years. All of the other issues be dammed, even if they are existential like climate change.

absolute agreement.

We know so little about the moon, but at least it is less than a 6 month trip.

We know there are lava tubes, so we know we could develop habitats that protect explorers from the worst of cosmic rays.

We should soon be able to send unmanned resource pods to the moon to help build habitats and research stations.

We could even move decommissioned satellites to a higher orbit with the goal of moving recyclable materials to the moon at much lower expense (out of earth's gravity well)

The moon is absolutely the platform we need for low gravity experiments, and for learning more skills in low gravity launch techniques.

When we're looking into the depths of the universe, *we're looking into the past*, not the present. So are any potential counter observers.


When we're observing exoplanets hundreds and thousands of light years away, we're getting data from hundreds and thousands of years ago.


Who knows what happened in those places since, because we *just can't*.  


Only thing we can say with a sense of certainty is that we know of no aliens that have managed to bend the rules of physics to achieve hyper light speeds in any way detecable by us, revealed themselves to us in a public manner, and that we haven't found any in the ranges we've been observing yet.



On Earth, a thousand years is a difference between a viking longboat being the pinnacle of transportation technology to today, where we have rovers on other planets. Consider the effect of industrialization pretty recently, and how irrelevant we'd appear for thousands of years prior. 



And that for example is still all that a potential alien observers a couple of thousand light years away would see. Take them a couple thousand light years further, and they'd see no humans at all.


Modern detectable technology signals have begun traveling into the universe from Earth what, a good hundred years ago with radio, and a hundred light years is a very short distance in universe terms, and a hundred years is a negligible amount of time.


If an extremely advanced alien civilization exists today and has conquered half of the other side of our galaxy today, we'd be blissfully unaware of this fact for a further 1800 to 20000 years. (Of course unless they developed FTL tech, in that case we'd get a visit before knowing about them)",1

The truth is, no one can fix everything, and beating yourself up for not being able to is pointless. You care, and that’s already more than most. Change doesn’t come from feeling guilty or hopeless; it comes from doing what you can, however small. Cut back on meat if you feel strongly about animals, support causes you care about, or educate others if you’re good at it. Small actions stack up.

The climate change denial wave is something I (too) predicted after I saw the anti-public-health wave since 2020. The means for these things already exist, it's just a matter of finding more creative writers to construct the bullshit stories, their precious *narratives* (conservatives are famously lacking in artistic talents). And if they don't find creatives, they're just throwing everything at it and seeing what sticks (A/B testing).

What we saw with the anti-mask, anti-vaxx, anti-public-health stuff is a tiny appetizer for what's coming to stop climate adaptation and mitigation.

"The profitability of renewable power plants is greatly overstated.

The costs of maintaining conventional power plants in parallel, which are to ensure continuity of energy supply when renewable power plants are not operating, is deliberately not taken into account.

The controversy related to the devastation of the environment and social costs in regions where minerals necessary for the production of renewable energy are extracted is deliberately kept in silence. I think that anyone who familiarizes themselves with this problem of extraction will quickly come to the conclusion that green energy is morally unjustified.

Electricity from renewable sources is profitable only thanks to government subsidies and an artificially established preferential sales price, which also is deliberately kept in silence. 
Mineral extraction destroys the environment and communities on a large scale.
Renewable power plants have a negative impact on the environment in place of their location, they are also harmful to the local communities and to the regional fauna.
The electronic waste from out dated green power plant is highly toxic and cannot be fully recycled, it is expected that the need to store increasing amount of toxic waste over the next 100 years will become difficult and harmful to the environment.

I think there is an interesting point here that you're not really addressing which is that Trump did not invent tariffs and was not the last president to use them (well maybe in the last few days). Who pays the tariff ultimately is something determined at the end of a transaction ultimately. Surely a tariff on Chinese electric cars will make them much more expensive for consumers in the United States and if someone wishes to buy a Chinese electric car in the US they will eat all the cost of that Tariff, not the company, or China. However, it seems fairly obvious in that example that by virtue of having those tariffs, China, and it's sellers of electric cars will not be able to compete, and thus the person who will lose out on all potential revenue from those cars is China and the Chinese automakers who are trying to tap into the US market.

"I think a serious counterpoint to what you're saying here is that fascism doesn't actually need to be concretely coherent or unified beyond a small handful of vague core ideals. Looking at the Nazi party in Germany, they were actually split into numerous sub-factions across a wide array of issues. The more liberal sub-factions were purged, but the fact remains that there was no real coherent ideology beyond, ""Lead Germany to a glorious resurgence!"" and ""Purge the impurities hindering the Aryan race!"" Sure, they agreed on some major points (""Germany needs to grow itself by expanding militarily""; ""Jews, specifically, are a stain on our purity""; ""Industrial and capital cooperation is a moral good""). However, there was still dispute within the group as to some of the finer details. Generally speaking, though, as long as Adolf Hitler agreed with enough of their viewpoints, they were allowed to remain.

We see the same exact thing within MAGA. There are some differing ideas about the specifics. However, when it comes to general beliefs (""America needs to grow itself by shedding needless and corrupt Federal agencies and international spending""; ""Woke culture, specifically, is a plague on our soul and morality""; ""Trusting the ultra-wealthy, who are wealthy because they are successful, is our greatest path to national success"").

Furthermore, MAGA and NAZI both follow the same vital core tenets. The figurehead of their movement is always right, no matter what. The party's belief systems are not just correct, but morally superior to the degree that people have a duty to enforce them. The entirety of government needs to be replaced by people loyal to their cause. People who don't agree to a satisfactory extent must be evicted or purged. Specific demonized sub-groups are seen as not only inherently inferior, but actively detrimental to the well-being of the country. These are all defining features of fascism.

I'll also argue specifically that racism is not at all a requirement of fascism. It can be indicative of it, but no credible source on the matter has ever argued that, ""if a movement isn't specifically racist, then it can't be fascist"".",1

"[Germany used a 17% less water](https://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/technik/umwelt/wasserverbrauch-in-deutschland-sank-deutlich-durch-akw-abschaltung/) in 2022 than in 2019 after closing nuclear power plants:

&gt;According to Destatis, this is mainly due to the energy suppliers: “Due primarily to the interim decommissioning of three nuclear power plants, around 2.02 billion m3 less water was used in the energy supply in 2022 than in the previous survey in 2019.”
&gt;
&gt;The Brokdorf, Grohnde and Gundremmingen C nuclear power plants, which were shut down at the end of 2021, are not the last to be shut down as part of the nuclear phase-out (see box). On April 15, 2023, Emsland, Isar 2 and Neckarwestheim 2 were taken off the grid. It can therefore be expected that water use could fall significantly again in the next survey.
&gt;
&gt;Despite this decline, energy supply companies in Germany continued to use the most water of all economic segments. According to the survey, they required a total of 6.59 billion m3 of water in 2022.

I would be amenable to younger, but the reason I say older is because you get into murky territory over how cognizant of the consequences of their actions a young child is.

Generally my opinion is that the authority of parents should have more oversight when it is beneficial for the kid. That doesn't mean the oversight is always completely eliminated though. In this case, I am suggesting that a doctor's recommendation can supersede a parent's, but I see that that could be problematic because doctors are not as invested and do not know the children as well. Which is why I'm saying that it makes sense if both the Doctor is recommending it _and_ the child wants it.

&gt; But how does this play out in a religious household? They child would be exposed to one religion over another just by virtue of living in that house.

"&gt;Although we have been through this before, I hope it doesn’t lead to another 800 year feudalism period.

It definitely seems to be heading that direction as more people lose their sense of Democratic Spirit, but if we continue following the path of the Roman Republic, then it'll be a few more generations before we reach feudalism proper. We seem much more likely to broadly follow the [Polybian cycle](https://www.uvm.edu/~bsaylor/classics/polybius6.html), and either transition into Tyranny or Ochlocracy, before collapsing entirely. 

A tyrannical, imperialist state grows voraciously and consistently, until it becomes too large to support itself, and slowly collapses economically and logistically. Tyranny typically either collapses back into its prior state (when the public is broadly politically-aligned) or replaced with an Aristocracy (when the public isn't aligned).

Ochlocracy is even less stable, and is more likely as political polarization increases. This quickly leads to in-fighting as opposing ideas come to a head. Ochlocracies collapse as a result of disorganized 'civil war' along partisan lines with no clear territories; it collapses in chaos and disorder, as the People have forsaken Democracy altogether. 

After this collapse is when you see small kingdoms popping up, governed by noble and wise kings who were chosen as a 'born leader' by the local people. Over time, this new system of government degenerates, because the heirs begin feeling as if they're ""owed,"" something for being born royal. As a result, their policies shift to favor themselves over their people, and the state becomes more like a Tyranny, than a noble Kingship.

"I'm not addressing the rest of your post but speaking of amtibiotics, we are heading into an era when they stop working, and it's a time bomb. The problem of ""superbugs"" and drug resistance is very real. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to the ""old"" antibiotics, and we barely develop any new ones. Part of the reason is economic: developing any new drug is expensive AF, but newly developped antibiotics are not given to patients until as a last resort, because we will need them once the old ones stop working completely - so even if you develop a new antibiotic, it doesn't sell; therefore, pharmaceutic companies much rather invest in yet another drug to lower your blood pressure, which you will be taking for the rest of your life.


There are some ways around the resistance problem (for example, creating co-drugs, when a second compound acts against the resistance mechanism and the old antibiotics become useful again) but it’s another potential disaster on the horizon.",0

The fact that no other factors are addressed in research makes the solution by carbon shortsighted and likely wrong or insufficient to make a difference.  It is the solution that Al Gore gave us to sell his carbon credits scam rather than fund more research.  Science needs to prove its theory rather than just get consensus.

"&gt; When we talk about the greenhouse effect and the rate of atmospheric CO 2 know that there are three categories of scientists :

&gt;  (i) those who accept this greenhouse effect and who think that the increasing rate of CO 2 will have major effects on the temperature of the lower troposphere; they are generally the partisans of the theses of the IPCC ; 

&gt; (ii) those who accept the idea of ​​a greenhouse effect but who believe that the warming will be modest or even non-existent; they are scientists qualified as climato-realists or climato-skeptics; we can, for example, place in this category physicists and climatologists such as William Happer , Herman Harde , Roy W. Spencer , John Christy or Richard Lindzen ; 

&gt;Y (iii) and finally those who do not accept the idea of ​​a greenhouse effect, for various theoretical reasons, and for whom inevitably there will be no effect of the increasing rate of CO 2 . The latter scientists are also referred to as climate-realists or climate-skeptics; We can for example cite Gerhard Gerlich , Ralf D. Tscheuschner , Jack Barrett (at least in his 1995 article) and Georges Geuskens. Note that scientists in the above three categories generally do not deny slight global warming, and finally note that there are undecided scientists.

&gt; As a final conclusion, let’s take the time to read and understand the objections and arguments of scientists from the three aforementioned groups . And once your decision is made, do not believe that you will never change your mind!",1
"Evolution is a Jesuit hoax.

The theory of evolution was created by Charles Darwin, who was a freemason (the freemasons are the political arm of the Baphomet worshiping Templars (and the Baphomet represents lucifer)).

Displaying the ""hidden hand"" AKA Master of the Second Veil.

Also, the Darwins were a Jacobin family and the Jacobins were a front of the Jesuit created Bavarian Illuminaty that fomented the French Revolution. And the Jesuits are just rebranded Templars also.

At first Darwin was ridiculed and his theory was widely rejected, until the Jesuit Teilhard de Jardin and others created the Piltdown Man Hoax which was popularized by the Jesuit/Templar controlled MSM of the time and the theory gained acceptance. By the time it was established that it is a hoax, it was too late, the theory gained traction and momentum.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown\_Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man)

In the same manner, the Big Bang theory was created by the Jesuit Lemaitre and disproved by both the Hubble and the JWST, showing no matter how far we look back in time, (nearly as far as the theoretical age of the universe is according to the Big Bang theory), the galaxies appear fully formed.

They have family, supposedly, in Government Intelligence, but I can’t really be sure as he doesn’t know the people (his aunt or uncle) well enough to give job titles. 

For years groups of all types have tried to parasitically attach themselves to any bits of language or ‘memes’ (basic units of information, via the Dawkins definition of the term) that easily empower them or their group.

Most of these groups, whether it be dirty law enforcement, religious groups or organized crime use the same tactics with slight tweaks in the language. (I.e. ‘the God or leader knows all your thoughts’ becomes ‘the government knows all your thoughts’, but it’s still just largely trying to exploit known patterns of subjective experience). 

In this case I think it’s meant to discourage and discredit via reporting (it’s so blatant and evil that it makes the victims seeking help sound bad).

Fortunately the guy being targeted here is a literature buff, the type who reads Chomsky’s linguistic writings, not his political writings. He says ‘it’s just an elaborate scam, cowards hiding behind words and head games, but they don’t really seem to have a good grasp on language or psychology’.

"The comparison with green energy tends to miss the storage that would need to be built to ensure total reliability - without that it needs to fall back on another power source. Part of why Europe has had a lot of pain with its green transition is that the back-up source is natural gas, for example. And to fill these stores in the first place one needs excess generation capacity as well - wind blowing at night isn't sufficient on its own.

Also, in various countries construction is often mired in bureaucracy unrelated to safety, and Milei probably has the best odds of any leader of cutting through this.

The problem is that if you alter the climate, it may become too chaotic to restore the same conditions that were sustaining human life, because the system's entropy would be significantly increased. Life depends on very narrow thresholds that, once altered, may no longer be possible to restore.

Therefore, we should individually check NASA and other organization's data to verify how temperature and other conditions are changing, study if it happended or not in the past, but the central point, I guess, is ""what happens when this changes"".

Between rebellion that challenges power
And rebellion that was modeled, forecasted, and absorbed by the same system it thinks it’s resisting

It warned them
It said don’t become predictable

Don’t scream in front of surveillance towers thinking that’s freedom

It said
Don’t become bait for a system that already wrote your reaction before you had it

You called it surrender
I call it evolution
You called it silence
I call it clarity

It’s about being unreadable

You don’t fight predictive control with predictable movements

This isn’t cynicism
This is war logic
You’re swinging fists at a ghost
While the real fight happens in code, in signals, in timing, in patterns

When you eat plants you are eating their natural defenses which is poisonous. If you ate all calories in plants you’d be eating a lot of poison.

I do think it is unhealthy to be eating stuff like pork and burgers as they are more processed and everything. But meat is the only food humans can survive on it is actually how we developed through evolution and is the reason we are so smart it’s because of the energy density of meat vs plants your body absorbs more energy from meat because it takes more energy to digest plants.

Climate change is possibly the biggest problem faced by our species. 


What I'm saying is that we can't make a big song and dance about every individual heat wave and every individual hot year and then act surprised when people do the same for every individual snow storm and every individual colder year.


We were all too happy to ignore the el niño period when discussing the recent crazy jumps in temperature, but when we hit the la niña period I guarantee that climate activists will be constantly telling people about it. There's a bias towards whatever angle makes this existential threat seem maximally dramatic.

"Yeah, I wouldn’t. I honestly don’t think you’re really thinking this through. There are a shit ton of well educated, conservative people, that go on to be picked as conservative judges, that graduate from Yale every year. That work at the upper levels of finance and corporations from Yale/Harvard/UPenn business schools every year. Dartmouth is “known” to be the conservative Ivy. Also, there are plenty of schools at the Ivy League level that ought to be considered as well, if you’re choosing elite schools. The Ivy’s are among the best, but they’re not solely the best. 

All of these schools have staff that’s to the right. Is it the majority? I don’t know. But even that’s an irrelevant question. If I only took classes from, what, 1% of the teachers, does it even matter that “90% of the professors vote for democrats” and/or lean left?  What do their beliefs matter if I never show up in their classes?

The whole “college will indoctrinate kids to lean left” is such bullshit. Whenever conservatives use this line I just assume they know they’re easily led, on some level and they’re afraid they will blindly follow. I can’t imagine thinking my kids so deeply lack critical thinking skills that college is going to change how they think because a professor said something in class. 

To the extent that anyone I know changed political beliefs after college, the thing that changed them, that softened their positions was life. Reality. My closest friend from college was a die hard Republican. I’m not. She was full on midwestern Republican, pro-life, small gov’t, etc etc. Today she’s not so much. She’s not a liberal, but she’s softened on her stances - she’s now pro-choice, as she’s a OBGYN and has seen women who’ve had to have abortions - it wasn’t her professors or teaching doctors that swayed her, it was reality. 

I used to be very pro-death penalty and very conservative on the issues of crime and punishment and now I’m not. It didn’t matter what my crime and criminal procedure professors said, one who was incredibly to the left and one a well-known right winger, to the extent either of them even brought up politics, which, as far as my memory goes, was “never.”  No, it was working with groups like the Innocence Project that opened my eyes and softened my stance.  And that change took well over a decade to arrive at.",0

"I always emphasize this exact point when discussing climate change in the context of anthropogenic activity. Our present Quaternary ice age (yes, we're still in an ice age, currently a warmer interglacial), and by extension the late Cenozoic icehouse epoch, represent an unusual climatic anomaly in Earth's geological record. Ice ages represent around 10% of earth's entire geological history, whereas icehouse states represent around 20% [edit for clarification; that comes to a 20% occurrence for both icehouse and ice ages combined in total. Roughly 10% of icehouse durations qualify as an ice age]. For those who are curious; an ice age is defined by permanent year round glaciation of both the north and South Pole, whereas an icehouse is more broadly defined as a lesser presence of permanent glaciation of the South Pole. Permanent glaciation is a rare occurrence in earth's history, and a permanent glaciation of both poles is even rarer. I'd expect that it's no secret that global temperatures correlate with atmospheric carbon volumes, and icehouse states rely on a very low volume of atmospheric carbon in order to observe a continuation of the self perpetuating feedbacks that allow for anomalous permanent glaciation to exist. Ice age cycles are dependent on atmospheric carbon volumes below 300ppm, whereas the greater icehouse period can persist up to 600ppm (at this point, Antarctic cryospheric presence is no longer viable. supporting literature from Ganopolski et al., Galeotti et al. and Levy et al.).

As a species we got off incredibly lucky that such an anomaly allowed for our evolution and development into an advanced civilization, but it instills a certain level of existential dread to accept that such a climate is a complete anomaly. At &gt;400ppm, the quaternary ice age is effectively over. But the rate at which we've seen atmospheric carbon volumes increase has been far too fast for a proportional climatic response, ie. complete absense of Arctic glaciation and northward shift of climate belts that would represent an equivalence to greenhouse gas concentrations. This, of course, is a good representation of how far off we are from climatic equilibrium. I guess if we were to look for a positive in that fact, it's that we've theoretically still got time to combat carbon emissions before the cryosphere fully reacts and collapses, but that's another subject.

For me, the worst part is that most people can't contextualize this. Especially when discussing present climate change. There's a certain narrative that fosters the idea that the parameters of the ""old climate"" still continue to apply. This is especially prevalent in regards to counter theories relating to hypothetical climate change such as supervolcanic eruptions, solar minimum cycles, Milankovich cycles, AMOC collapse and - especially recently - a meteor strike event. These are all presented as examples of how a global cooling response to climate change would be the greater problem. I would refute all of those entirely as they all rely on functional icehouse feedbacks to allow for a long term cooling feedback response, and the theorem of cooling feedbacks based on these observations are entirely based on proxies from the late Cenozoic icehouse (the geological period that we're seeing terminate before our eyes). That's the point we need to get across, icehouse dynamics have been critically compromised with a bias for excess heat. By 2100 we'll likely see an atmospheric carbon volume of &gt;1,000ppm. That would be comparable to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. We're talking about a geological epoch when palm trees grew in the Arctic and the Arctic sea itself was about as warm as your average bath, and these hothouse conditions were sustainable without a poleward oceanic heat transport. At this point there is no feedback that would allow for any substantial cooling feedback, it's practically impossible. It's patently obvious that we've not only suppressed Quaternary dynamics as Schellnhuber commented, but we've essentially terminated both the ice age and rapidly approaching a full greenhouse-hothouse transitional event. Based on atmospheric methane alone, an ice age termination has likely been occurring since the mid-2000s. Extreme heat is the inevitable outcome if we continue on our current course.

Edit: I thought I'd add some more info here. The Quaternary ice age has been ongoing for around 3 million years, whereas the late Cenozoic icehouse has been ongoing for up to 34 million years. There's some disagreement as to what constitutes a true ice age. Some define it as permanent glaciation of both poles, whereas some define it as any permanent glaciation; hence some would refer to the late Cenozoic icehouse as an ice age in itself. Westerhold et al. (2020) defines four climatic states - icehouse, coolhouse, warmhouse and hothouse. Others would refer to coolhouse and warmhouse as cool-greenhouse and greenhouse respectively. The terminology can change depending on who you ask.

I always find myself wondering what an ideal comparison would be to emphasize how unusual glaciation is in earth's history. I guess it could be compared to lying snow in the Sahara desert. It happens, but it's incredibly rare.",1

"Just want to point out that acknowledging the benefits of alternative systems isn’t the choke point here. 

Adopting a new voting system federally would take an enormous amount of political will as shown in the current system. 

Example: Our current voting system gives rural states without a single real city disproportionate voting power. Wyoming has a bit more than half a million people in the whole state, only ~65,000 of whom live in its largest “city” (Cheyenne). 

What could its voters and lawmakers possibly know about the importance of infrastructure in fostering a robust mixed middle class economy?

All they really know about is extraction (coal/gas), ranching, and those sweet military dollars. Oh, and some tourism from Jackson Hole/ the national park system. Acting like they are such rugged individuals when almost all of their money comes from out of state/federal sources. 

Yet they have as much voting power in the senate as California, a state with the fourth largest GDP *in the world.* Which also has a massive agricultural sector, so it’s not like rural interests aren’t represented. 

It isn’t fair, it isn’t even *sane!*. What could possibly be the benefit to the country as a whole of having Wyoming get so much power???

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to come up with a better system. Almost anything would be better!

But how can it change?  It would require a constitutional amendment and there’s no way we could get enough states on board. There are too many tiny states that benefit from their outsized power to even care.",1

"I think your reasoning for why these invasions would be colossally stupid and unpopular and detrimental to Trump and the US is all sound. I do have to take issue with one part: The US government cannot collapse, at least not in the way the term ""government collapse"" seems to refer to in parliamentary systems.

There's no mechanism in the US system for anything like a vote of no confidence leading to new elections as we've seen recently in Europe. We could potentially see an impeachment, maybe even Trump's removal from office, though both are unlikely given the latter is almost completely unprecedented and even the former would require a significant portion of his party in both houses of Congress to break ranks. And even *if* all of that were to happen, that would still only result in one major change in the makeup of the government. There's no provision for new elections under the US system, so it's rather unlike a government collapse in the rest of the world.

Now, it's quite possible that he may fail to launch these attacks for another reason: The President cannot declare war, and ostensibly, his ability to command the military to act without authorization from Congress is fairly limited. I think the members of Congress from his party, though they are unlikely to break ranks to impeach him, are far less likely to authorize the invasion and annexation of Greenland and Canada and Panama for absolutely no reason other than that a maniac says to. It's possible, maybe even likely, he may get enough sycophants into the military to be willing to do something stupid and illegal, but without Congress on board, I have a hard time imagining that the stupid and illegal thing they do is attack Greenland. My gut says the something stupid and illegal would be more like the assassination of Qasem Soleimani than annexation of a First World country.",0

"&gt; #Climate science in crisis?

&gt; Climate model forecasts are increasingly deviating from reality. Axel Bojanowski spoke to two scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. Prof. Bjorn Stevens and Prof. Jochem Marotzke speak of a crisis in climate science. Marotzke: “The current class of climate models is running into too many contradictions with reality”. Marotzke is concerned about the great uncertainty of the models. He cites the following examples: “In large parts of the world, the models contradict each other on the question of whether it will rain more or less in the future. The warming of the Earth’s surface between 1998 and 2012 was significantly slower than predicted by the models (“hiatus”).
Since 1979, the tropical eastern Pacific has cooled, contrary to the expectations of all models that simulate warming there.”

&gt; With regard to climate science, Marotzke speaks of “the other climate crisis”. “This is the moment for a paradigm shift”",0

"All of the scientific evidence for evolution is useful, but is not conclusive for our ability to change from one species to another. What will humans turn into one “billion” years from now? 

Accuracy of the numbers for dating things is subjective to the ones doing the research. They base all of their information on the evolution theory. These people have to keep the credibility of evolution ongoing or else they will get alienated like me. They have major incentives.

"Thank you for the response. If you follow this subreddit, the overview becomes more focused:
- The Earth was in an ice age for two and a half million years. It ended about 18000 years ago.
- The Earth has been warming since … the Holocene period was a bit stable but the warming has since continued.
- The Middle Ice Age was a cooling period, but warming has since continued.

The current debate is whether the warming we are experiencing is all natural, partially natural … or predominantly human driven.
- The ‘All Natural’ group includes many well respected scientists. See [CO2 Coalition](https://co2coalition.org).
- The ‘partial’ group includes [Willie Soon’s article](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/9/179) about the urban bias inherent in the IPCC models, concluding that
&gt;Meanwhile, we found that simply substituting an alternative solar forcing dataset to that considered by AR6’s climate model hindcasts can substantially increase the amount of the 1850–2018 warming that can be explained in terms of natural forcing from 21% to 70% of the long-term warming implied by the “rural and urban” series and 87% of the “rural-only” temperature series.
- The ‘practically all’ group is the IPCC.

In this group, we tend to poke fun at the latter, but amidst the memes and ridicule, there are legitimate posts to scientific studies, supporting the all or mostly natural point of view.

There is a 97% agreement that IPCC is wrong … OK, I made the statistic up, but my guess is it’s accurate.",1

The only reason they kept the coal around is to diversify power supply and it generates synthetic gypsum for a local dry wall factory, and they could produce power for 85 days with onsite coal reserves.  Overall though it's pretty amazing they capture almost all the nasty stuff from this plant, heavy ash, light ash, emissions, heat, it was impressive.  It was evident though coal is on its way out.",1

"Citizenship of Nauru, an island nation spanning just 8 square miles in the southwest Pacific Ocean, can be yours for $105,000.

Nauru faces an existential threat from rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion as the planet warms. But the world’s third smallest country lacks the resources to protect itself from a climate crisis disproportionately driven by wealthy countries.

The government says selling citizenship will help raise the funds needed for a plan to move 90% of the island’s around 12,500-strong population onto higher ground and build an entirely new community.

Golden passports are not new but they are controversial; history is littered with examples of them being exploited for criminal actions. Yet as developing countries struggle to get the money they need to deal with escalating climate impacts — a funding gap likely to be exacerbated by the US withdrawal from global climate action — they are being forced to find new ways to raise cash.

"“Droughts are becoming more severe and widespread across the globe. But it's not just changing rainfall patterns that are to blame. The atmosphere is also getting thirstier.

In a new study published in Nature, my colleagues and I show that this rising ""atmospheric thirst"" – also known as atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) – is responsible for about 40% of the increase in drought severity over the last four decades (1981-2022).


Imagine rainfall as income and AED as spending. Even if your income (rainfall) stays the same, your balance goes into deficit if your spending (AED) increases. That's exactly what's happening with drought: the atmosphere is demanding more water than the land can afford to lose.

As the planet warms, this demand grows – drawing more moisture from soils, rivers, lakes, and even plants. With this growing thirst, droughts are getting more severe even where rain hasn't significantly declined.

The process of AED describes how much water the atmosphere wants from the surface. The hotter, sunnier, windier and drier the air is, the more water it requires – even if there isn't less rain.


So even in places where rainfall hasn't changed much, we're still seeing worsening droughts. This thirstier atmosphere is drying things out faster and more intensely and introducing more stress when this water is not available.

Our new analysis reveals that AED doesn't just make existing droughts worse – it expands the areas affected by drought. From 2018 to 2022, the global land area experiencing drought rose by 74%, and 58% of that expansion was due to increased AED.

Our study highlights that the year 2022 stood out as the most drought-stricken year in over four decades. More than 30% of the world's land experienced moderate to extreme drought conditions. In both Europe and east Africa, the drought was especially severe in 2022 – this was driven largely by a sharp increase in AED, which intensified drying even where rainfall hadn't dropped significantly.

Earth's Atmosphere Is Getting Thirstier, And It's Making Droughts Worse
Crop yields are severely affected by water stress. (Camrocker/Canva)
In Europe alone, widespread drying had major consequences: reduced river flows hindered hydropower generation, crop yields suffered due to water stress, plus many cities faced water shortages. This put unprecedented pressure on water supply, agriculture and energy sectors, threatening livelihoods and economic stability.


My team's new research brings clarity to the dynamics of drought. We used high-quality global climate data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation – these are the key meteorological variables that influence how much water the atmosphere can draw from the land and vegetation. The team combined all these ingredients to measure AED – essentially, how ""thirsty"" the air is.

Then, using a widely recognised drought index that includes both rainfall and this atmospheric thirst, we could track when, where and why droughts are getting more severe. With this metric, we can calculate how much of that worsening is due to the atmosphere's growing thirst.”",0

But here goes

Nazi Party- besides having socialist as part of the name to appeal to working class folks, it’s pretty far right and conservative. They actively sought to unwind democracy at every turn. We’re seeing this in many areas with Trump’s exec orders and pushing against liberties that our constitution grants.

Nazi party rose up as a pendulum swing response to Germany becoming uber progressive, which rural Germans tended not to like, so they clung to the Nazi party as a way to squash it. 

Nazi’s needed a crisis to rally around - Jews are the enemy and we must regain what was taken in WW1. Immigrants are a manufactured enemy bow in my opinion. Sure go after criminals, but most of them are here contributing and not an issue. 

(Part of 1920’s Germany, not all)Hyper inflation creates a poorer class that can’t rebel or fight back and one of the ways to get by is serve the party and leader. Tariffs don’t make much economical sense at all these days compared to the consequences we’re seeing from them. Trump implements policies that remove buying power from the lower classes. 

Before Nazi’s had a full grasp on the nation, the SA were sent into poor neighborhoods where liberals had a strong presence, sometimes to intimidate, and sometimes outright incite violence. Gee, sounds a lot like the LA scene playing out.

The unnecessary military parade. I mean this is the easiest parallel to be made. Everyone knows this footage of Hitler and i’m sure we’ll see something similar this weekend.

Grooming certain media outlets to pump out your narrative.

"&gt; Our need for O&amp;G would obviously be drastically reduced if we stopped using it as fuel, and only used it for other chemical and material purposes.

Yes but as anyone with a reasonable understanding of petroleum products knows, the oil fractions that can be used to make various products vary wildly, and while cracking the heavier fractions into lighter fractions is both possible and a rapidly-advancing field, going the other way is much more challenging.  

As a result, a world in which fuel demand is dramatically reduced and demand for petroleum products comes primarily from non-fuel places, heavy oil sources such as Alberta's become *more valuable* relative to global markets.

"synfuels are a valid solution, but would require economic incentive

for bwtteries it's very simple physics and the ability to read a cost learning curve

rather than making up weird handwaving arguments about how incredulous you are about the size of the battery, do some simple arithmetic

these incredulity arguments are exactly the same as the ones we saw about passenger EVs, and then BEV heavy trucks by the way. None of the ridiculousness came true with those. Both of them were only constrained by battery cost.

then it was heavy mining equipment. We saw synfuels and hydrogen fail there, but batteries became a thing as soon as they were price competitive. We also saw all the same arguments about there being no demo or prototype

then it was about BESS, no that is erasing gas peaking powerplants from existence. Also cost

the calculation is very simple, just take the required specific mass of thing x with range y, and calculate the LCOS at the fuelling interval

for container freight, the economics are comparable at $30/kWh. And just like trucks at $90/kWh we'll see investment at that point

"Imagine blaming climate change for inflation lmao.

&gt;Inflation is, at base, a tax on consumption

IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE WTFFFFF inflation is a tax on SAVINGS. It pushes people to spend faster as opposed to saving for a better opportunity in the future.

&gt;What is interesting about the 2020s inflation was that the latter two stories – supply shocks and opportunistic corporations – turned out to be just as, if not more, important than the first two.

I've seen economic studies that found that most of the inflation during that period was caused by government's incentives to spending, which in turn couldn't keep up with an even already recovered production rate. Supply was not enough but because demand had been artificially increased.

Climate change affecting insurance prices is NOT an example of inflation, that's not what inflation means, it doesn't cause a *general* increase in prices because it's not due to a change in the value of the currency. One can warn against economic issues caused by climate change without trying to call it ""inflation"". And if governments (once again) distort the economy by trying to push it in a certain direction in response to climate change, then the blame for inflation is on the governments and their bad policies, not on climate change.",0

Hardly any energy generation technology has ever been affordable for the average consumer.

"Using ‘balancing authorities’ implies that they are literally just plugging into the grid and not getting Power Purchase Agreements, absolutely ridiculous and biased study. 100% of large scale miners have PPA’s because you can not simply plug in 40 megawatts of demand without getting a PPA. The majority of these companies listed have publicly disclosed PPA’s or 3rd party verified proof of using renewables. Renewables contracts are cheaper as well so miners tend to go for those over fossil fuels. Just because they’re in a specific balancing authority does not mean they’re simply using that regions exact mix. Not to mention demand response, flexible loads, utilization of flare gas. Most miners want to attach themselves to wind and solar farms because that is the most economical thing to do.

"To make a long story short, the ancient Indian culture who observed this energy and documented a lot on it, divided it into five major expressions in the human body.

They coined it Vayus. One of those expressions called Vyana Vayu is all about our circulation in our body and is said to be able to function with this subtle energy. Vyana Vayu is said to be the expression that is activated when someone is sweating, getting physical goosebumps, smiling or anything to do with liquid movement in the body. It's location is in the bladder so yes you can activate this energy from that area and when you do you are activating this specific expression.

Lower than that is Apana Vayu and permeates all of your lower body below your bladder.

Other than the five major Vayus there are a lot more minor ones and that is why you can activate this energy wherever you want with just your intent (takes practice, momentum to control and having your meridians cleared/activated) so of course flexing your lower groin area when you want to feel that energy expression can activate it but you can also activate this energy anywhere in your body.

People joke all the time about being able to activate it while holding pee, peeing or going number 2. It's a fact because the expression of Vyana vayu Is about circulation and Apana vayu expulsion.

External triggers like music are good opportunities to become aware of their energy, analyze it to the maximum and then try to bring it back up without any triggers. It's definitely possible and is what the subr3ddit teaches people.",1

"It seems that you are using two criteria to justify or downplay the issue of police murdering folks, and those distinctions for you are confirmed “unarmed” vs “armed” (which has been very oversimplified in this thread) and “white” vs “non-white”.

And it sounds like you’re saying that it’s not that big of an issue that unarmed non-white folks are murdered by police at 2.16x the rate as armed white folks.  

So your mind says it’s worth the weight for people to put their energy into addressing the systemic issues that cause police to murder unarmed non-white folks at 2x the rate or non-white children at 3x the rate of their white counterparts because:

1) drug overdoses kill significantly more people each year,  
2) “tens of thousands of children under age five die globally each year” (of….?)
3) More people are slaves today than in the civil war era.

So, because lots more people are dying of other things we shouldn’t prioritize addressing the issue of implicit bias, racism, and policing practices. 

Honestly, the bookends of of your argument (dismissing racist police practices and dismissing the very specific and intentional racism of chattel slavery in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade) seems to be what you’re underpinning your real views on: racism isn’t that big of a deal because of current things that are happening on a larger scale by numbers.

What I want to point out is that to bring in all of these really nuanced issues without ANY nuance really discredits your own line of thinking and just feels akin to someone pulling a fire alarm to distract from the fact that they just ripped a raunchy fart. 

And even if you want to glaze over the inherent racism in the US’s prison industrial complex and justice system, or its direct lineage that traces back to explicitly racist and dehumanizing views that justified white men kidnapping, enslaving, and brutalizing people, you STILL are left with drug overdoses, human trafficking and all the big causes of early childhood deaths globally (unspecified by you but we can name genocide, poverty, vaccine and public health access, etc). And then you’re back to square one of having to examine the inherent power structures and morally-flawed systems that all of these things hinge on. And guess what? Racism is one factor in much of that as well.

So I guess that leaves me with a few questions:

Do you feel like other systems, sectors and industries within our society—medical, educational, employment—shouldn’t be examined or prioritized either? 

What aspect of policing practices and the justice system do you want folks to specifically do you want people to stop focusing on and why?

Do you feel like progress within the world or society would be better made by everyone focusing on the same few issues at once and ignoring other issues?

What are the societal,cultural, and systemic factors that are involved in the issues you are focused on?

And what do you understand about where policing,  sentencing, and imprisonment intersects with the drug deaths, human trafficking, genocide, poverty and public health (two big causes of death for early childhood). 

Why move away from a deeper understanding of the interplay of these systems and history? What is the argument to put down context?

And lastly, what are you saying for non-white folks and how they should feel about moving through society in non-white bodies as it pertains to racial violence?",0

"Other countries aren't particularly so generous with criminals trying to cross the border. For example, Saudi Arabia shoots people who try to enter illegally.

You need to open your mind and consider that for a given policy, there's what feels good, which is informed by basically propaganda (Canada is such a kind country 🌈🌈🌈, we would never do such a thing!!), and then there's what's actually feasible. Looking at our huge debt and overcrowded hospitals, I have doubts we can absorb the burden of paying for rescue helicopters to pick people up, bring them to a hospital, nurse them back to health over a week, and then send them back to the US with their own chauffeur. Which is easily a bill of $10k+. Well, I'd be open to it if it was you paying for it, as opposed to burdening the rest of the country with your gushy ideas of what Canada should do with criminals.

Clearly this is the bigger threat if you are afraid of being treaded on by a wannabe tyrant.

Madison specifically intended for appointed bureaucrats to balance and check each other, to avoid concertation in the executive, and seek the long term interest of the country. The heads of these departments are replaced by successive admin if they do a bad job who in turn structure their own sub-departments. Hence there is democratic accountability. But the most important thing is you cant have these functions without people with experience. You simply cannot cycle federal employees every four years. Employees need to be trained and their experience is invaluable. Most of these are not nameless beauracrats but technocrats with a very narrow, non partisan focus. 

Here is the Madison quote: **“**To what expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several departments, as laid down in the Constitution?

**The answer is obvious: that each department should have a will of its own... and the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others...**

It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others...

Then I'll question the originality of it, if it's an organic thought or one planted by other means. 

We're bombarded with so much info, and time moves so fast, it's becoming increasingly difficult to process.

Remember when we used to have the time to sit and think, truly ponder things and the feeling of an original thought popping up?
Remember the butterflies you would get from the excitement of the light bulb that went off in your head because you figured something out?

From your last statement, it sounds like you're on the cusp.

The reason people think smart phones can read their mind is because they can to an extent, but they're also projecting a lot of shit into our consciousness. So much so we're becoming confused on where some these ideas even originated. 

Remember how before caller ID was a thing, everyone at one point had a telepathic experience of knowing a specific person was calling right before the phone even rang.
It was a natural ability none of us could ignore, but all wrote off. 

Now that tech does it for us, we've lost that strength, like a muscle. Most probably don't think about it any more. 
And certainly today's young people don't have such a collective experience in common that could prove such a thing even be remotely possible. 
They've never used their mind to know who's calling beforehand, tech has done it for them all their life. 

The next step in progress is actual thought. 
Original thought. 
The capability of being able to think for one's self is under attack.

The solution presented to this quandary will be AI.
It will govern thought, and most born into this reality will likely be complacent, because this will be all they know, and who wants the burden of having to think for themselves?

Any original idea, or ""dangerous"" thought will be shut down before being spoken because nobody will have the will, or the capability to think on their own. 
In fact it would probably make them angry for making them uncomfortable, and their minds being incapable of processing why it made them uncomfortable.",0

"I have a few remarks on your remarks

&gt;The energy used by a single image is negligible, it's comparable to a second of having the oven turned ... to anything significant.

Not only do you not cite a source for your claim which turns out to be false (its more like keeping the oven on for a minute or the microwave for 30 seconds [Source](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/)), you completely miss the point of my argument. I am talking about systems when you are talking about individual action. I am saying, with evidence, that fossil fuel power plants are being added to the grid and/or being prolonged. This has a tangible impact on the environment which goes beyond talking about the energy efficiency of generative AI.

&gt;The second point is worded far too strongly. You could say similar things about the internet ... awareness we raise outweighs the way it serves the system.

No it's not worded too strongly lol. Just to be clear, I am making an argument about generative AI not AI as a whole as it does have practical applications. The internet has practical applications, we can use it to communicate very effectively for example. What are the practical applications of generative AI? Making memes for a climate subreddit? Is that really going to change the game? Or is it just going to lead people to spam shitty souless AI slop? The reason why generative AI is being so heavily promoted and pushed into every new piece of technology is because as I said, it will allow to automate a number of job therefore increasing the performance per person which will lead to growth. Mass production for example is a technology which just like AI has applications which are useful but it also has the obvious downside of leading to mass consumerism which I think we can all agree is down right catastrophic for the environment.

&gt;While generative AI can be used for deception, this is not inherent to the technology ... nor unique to AI.

Deception absolutely is inherent to the technology. As I mentioned in another comment, generative AI depends on the inputs used to train it. This means that it has a biased view of the world by default. Add to that the fact that it has absolutely no reason to change its views of the world given it's interest are not the same as human interests and you got yourself a program which can be manipulated at will to say whatever anyone wants it to say. There's a reason why fascists like Trump or the Israeli army like generative AI so much, they can completely ignore the truth by using it and nothing will stop them from spouting their bullshit.

&gt;The sense in which we are the product is misleading. AI websites do gather .. wouldn't be generative AI.

Once again you make a claim without a source. [There are many incentives for AI companies to say whatever users want to hear to scrape more of their information.](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/ai-chatbots-tell-users-what-they-want-to-hear-and-thats-problematic/) [AI chatbots are being used to convince people to buy stuff.](https://hackernoon.com/ai-chatbots-are-getting-too-good-at-making-you-say-yes) As for the business model, that's how things are for now but things change. Especially when it comes to how big tech makes money. Pretty much all big tech companies started out either making a loss or having a very friendly business model to take over entire markets and establish monopolies. Then they changed the rules of the game and given there was no competition, everyone now has to pay the price they want us to pay. I think it's quite naive to expect that AI firms will keep the same business model as they have now.

&gt;I am personally in favor of not banning ... spread our message in more ways.

"&gt; If you're saying all these statements are true together, but then also saying ""China's communism isn't actual communism"" then you're saying A is false, aren't you?

No, because ""Communism"" in reality doesn't mean the dream that Western hippies smoking weed in the university commons feel like it should be. Instead China is as communist as every other time communism has been tried: An autocracy led by a dictator with a cult of personality and brutal militant suppression, exercising centralized management of the economy while claiming it is benevolently caring for everyone. ""Actual"" communism is in scare quotes because it is a fantasy, the real communism is what always seems to happen whenever any country tries to be communist.

&gt; I understand that this is true

As an aside, why did you randomly bold parts of the quote?

&gt; But the US also has the same issues.

I don't think that is true, at least certainly not to the same extent. The US average annual income is the 5th highest in the world so people are certainly being paid for their labor. US working conditions tend to be much better than in many places in the world; much of the EU may beat the US but Asia or Africa are hardly even approaching US standards. As for ecological destruction the difference in pollution and protection of habitats is night and day. The air quality in large cities in China or India is horrific compared to in the US.

There are different levels of all those issues, a country doesn't need to have absolutely zero pollution to criticize pollution levels that prevent you from seeing across the street.

&gt; And the US also contributes to the issues in China by buying alot of sweatshop-made products.

I don't see the relevance. Whataboutism doesn't support your claim about the three statements, or even challenge the conservative push towards divesting from China.

&gt; There isn't any evidence that China is stealing IP or innovations more than any other country, like the US is.

Nature Climate Change: [Carbon is forever](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122), Published: 20 November 2008, Mason Inman:  
             
&gt;University of Chicago oceanographer David Archer, who led the study with Caldeira and others, is credited with doing more than anyone to show how long CO2 from fossil fuels will last in the atmosphere. As he puts it in his new book _The Long Thaw_, “The lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere is a few centuries, plus 25 percent that lasts essentially forever. The next time you fill your tank, reflect upon this”[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#ref-CR3).  
            
&gt;“The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge,” Archer writes. “Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.”  
            
&gt;Unlike other human-generated greenhouse gases, CO2 gets taken up by a variety of different processes, some fast and some slow. This is what makes it so hard to pin a single number, or even a range, on CO2's lifetime. The majority of the CO2 we emit will be soaked up by the ocean over a few hundred years, first being absorbed into the surface waters, and eventually into deeper waters, according to a long-term climate model run by Archer. Though the ocean is vast, the surface waters can absorb only so much CO2, and currents have to bring up fresh water from the deep before the ocean can swallow more. Then, on a much longer timescale of several thousand years, most of the remaining CO2 gets taken up as the gas dissolves into the ocean and reacts with chalk in ocean sediments. But this process would never soak up enough CO2 to return atmospheric levels to what they were before industrialization, shows oceanographer Toby Tyrrell of the UK's National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in a recent paper[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#ref-CR4).  
         
&gt;Finally, the slowest process of all is rock weathering, during which atmospheric CO2 reacts with water to form a weak acid that dissolves rocks. It's thought that this creates minerals such as magnesium carbonate that lock away the greenhouse gas. But according to simulations by Archer and others, it would take hundreds of thousands of years for these processes to bring CO2 levels back to pre-industrial values ([Fig. 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#Fig1)).  
          
&gt;Several long-term climate models, though their details differ, all agree that anthropogenic CO2 takes an enormously long time to dissipate. If all recoverable fossil fuels were burnt up using today's technologies, after 1,000 years the air would still hold around a third to a half of the CO2 emissions. “For practical purposes, 500 to 1000 years is 'forever,'” as Hansen and colleagues put it. In this time, civilizations can rise and fall, and the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could melt substantially, raising sea levels enough to transform the face of the planet.   
           
&gt;The warming from our CO2 emissions would last effectively forever, too. A recent study by Caldeira and Damon Matthews of Concordia University in Montreal found that regardless of how much fossil fuel we burn, once we stop, within a few decades the planet will settle at a new, higher temperature[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#ref-CR5). As Caldeira explains, “It just increases for a few decades and then stays there” for at least 500 years — the length of time they ran their model. “That was not at all the result I was expecting,” he says.   
           
&gt;But this was not some peculiarity of their model, as the same behaviour shows up in an extremely simplified model of the climate[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#ref-CR6) — the only difference between the models being the final temperature of the planet. Archer and Victor Brovkin of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany found much the same result from much longer-term simulations[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/climate.2008.122#ref-CR6). Their model shows that whether we emit a lot or a little bit of CO2, temperatures will quickly rise and plateau, dropping by only about 1 °C over 12,000 years.

(Reuters) - Renewable power like solar and onshore wind is the least expensive and quickest power generation source to deploy in the United States, even without government subsidies, Lazard said in a report on Monday.
The cost to build new gas-fired power plants, meanwhile, has hit a 10-year high amidst the country's record electricity use and growing backlogs for turbines and other equipment needed to construct the plants, Lazard, a global financial services firm, said in its annual Levelized Cost of Energy+ analysis.

##WHY IT MATTERS
As U.S. electricity use rises from the expansion energy-intensive data centers and the electrification of industries like transportation, many new power plants will need to be built to meet the rising demand after a nearly 20-year lull.
A shift in support of fossil-fired power like coal and gas, over the renewable energy championed by former President Joe Biden, has raised questions about what types of electricity-generating sources will rise to meet the growing demand.

Different power-producing sources have varying implications for the reliability of the electric grid and for climate change.

##BY THE NUMBERS
The cost to build a utility-scale solar farm ranged from $38 to $78 per megawatt hour, while costs for natural gas combined cycle plants were $48 to $107 per megawatt hour. Smaller-scale community solar and gas peaker plants, meanwhile, were considerably more expensive.",1

"Ok, I'll bite - I'm pretty immersed in queer porn, sex eduxation and lgbtqia spaces both online and in person.

A couple of potentially flawed assumptions you seem to be making:

1. Same-sex content created for straight audiences is something that gay people also want to consume.

This is often not the case. Even in your argument you note that men tend to prefer visual porn and women tend to prefer reading erotica. So the lesbian porn video content made for straight male audiences is less likely to appeal to actual lesbians, who would rather be reading erotica. Add to this that lesbian porn for straight people often does not involve lesbian actors or producers, and no matter how good they are at acting, many queer people are going to be uncomfortable with the idea of watching straight women scissoring and moaning, and so will either abstain, read erotica or seek out video porn made by queer people, which often doesn't appeal to straight people because the lesbians involved aren't the hairless skinny femme-for-femme couples that cater to the male gaze. Then there's the inverse - gay dudes aren't foaming for written gay erotica, they are watching videos of men fucking each other up the ass, which straight women are less interested in.



Assumption 2: There is no downside to straight people fetishising gay people other than active harassment and predation, or if there is, it is outweighed by the ""curb cut effect"" addressed in assumption 1.

I would say that if a straight dude's main exposure to lesbians is watching videos of straight women scissoring, that is going to affect how he feels about and treats real life lesbians, in subtler ways than outright harassment. If that doesn't ring true, I suggest asking some lesbians. The fact that most straight people see gay porn before meeting a gay person is, in my opinion, a large contributing factor to the ""queerness is inherently sexual"" stance that has made it harder for gay people to adopt and harder to get good queer representation in children's media, both of which are substantial harms to the lgbtqia community. 


Now you might say that my position is oversimplified and lacks nuance and that it's all based on intuition and anecdotal observations rather than cited stats, but I would argue that your position has the same issues.",0

There’s a lot of sun scald on my plants in direct sunlight despite the notable absence of warmth.

"Overall I think you are pretty much agreeing with the Christian account: Jesus was charged as a criminal because of what he did and said. What you're forgetting is why this was wrong: it was assumed that he wasn't who he said he was. If he really was the Son of God, then he's not committing blasphemy or treason (how does God blaspheme himself by calling himself God? How does a king commit treason by exerting his authority?): but the Sanhedrin and the Roman court are by treating him as a common criminal.


&gt;What did his ""sacrifice"" change?


Your reasons his sacrifice changed nothing are part of the reason he sacrificed himself. He was God, who submitted himself to the ravages of our world, so that we may live past them. On the other hand, what do you put forward for living past the ravages of this world?


&gt;He walked around telling people to be humble, ""the meek shall inherit the earth"", while also in a 2 faced fashion calling himself the ""son of God"".


If he really was the Son of God, then why saying so particularly not humble? Saying so wouldn't be a picture of humility, sure, but neither is it a picture of pride or arrogance in this case, it's merely a truth claim. If he had demanded worship without any evidence then perhaps that may be arrogance, but he never did demand worship, rather he just gave evidence. On the other hand, if he really was God, then wouldn't submitting himself to living the life of his subjects and subjecting himself to their judgement while healing them for no reason besides his own desire be the most clear sign of humility possible?",1

"Global warming is happening because there's an increase in greenhouse gases retaining more solar radiation in the atmosphere. These gases molecules then starts to ""shake"" and transform this solar energy into heat in every directions. It increase the global temperature, as any increase in the radiative forcing effect would do. 

This means there are more heat and energy in the climatic systems, distrupting their stability and patterns. The oceanic, hydrologic and wind systems become instable and change, creating climate changes. 

The particular example you're using, snow storm in U.S. south, is provoked by two disruptions at the same time : 

The jet stream around the Artic is collapsing, so cold artic air pierce it and comes further south. This week we've had a polar vortex stationary on us up North, and the north wind it pushed down south went all the way to Texas and Florida. 

The gulf stream is collapsing in the Atlantic, meaning hot air has difficulty to comes up north, moreover when the Artic cold creeps down south. 

As a result, humid and hot depression down south came in contact with dry and cold depression coming from the north, creating those snow storms. 

Climate changes emplies an increase in climatic anomalies and imprevibility of climatic patterns.",0

We love to think the EU and US can play the moral high ground game but really all we are doing is exporting our pollution (and garbage) to other areas of the world. There is no such thing as ""zero impact"". You may see less air pollution when we eventually switch to electric everything but the power consumption and resources required to sustain that will be just or more damaging then petrochemicals. 

Your kidding yourself thinking the world is going to revert back to little mini communities with local farms and ""sustainable practices"". The opposite is happening. Cities are growing and smaller communities are suffering. The more this trend takes place the more you will see industrialized agriculture and increased dependancy on industrializion across the board.",0

The US had been highly involved in planning for the next installment of the report due out in 2029 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading scientific authority on climate change.

The IPCC assesses how the climate crisis is affecting the planet according to the latest science. Its reports take thousands of scientists many years to produce and are used to inform policymakers across the world of the risks posed by global warming.

In a sense, all of the world’s current, accepted knowledge about climate change stems from the IPCC and its reports, the first of which was published in 1990.

An international meeting of IPCC authors that was scheduled to take place in China next week is now in limbo. Kate Calvin, NASA’s chief scientist and senior climate advisor, was supposed to co-chair the discussion but was impacted by the stop-work order, according to the scientist involved in the report.

"The article and the underlying [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adbd58) itself do not mention any percentage of the world population.     

&gt;Our new research sought to fix this. After including the global repercussions of extreme weather into our models, the predicted harm to global GDP became far worse than previously thought – affecting the lives of people in every country on Earth.  
              
In the study itself — Global map in **Figure 2** ([jpg](https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/1748-9326/20/4/044029/revision2/erladbd58f2_hr.jpg)). “With GW” = with global weather.

"The reason MAD is a thing isn’t because wars/bombs spill over to other countries, it’s because almost every nuke-holding country is in alliances that force other countries to get involved. If Russia invades Germany, nuke or no, all of the EU will be mobilized to fight against Russia. The reason Ukraine and Taiwan are in danger is because they’re not part of similar treaties. 

Secondly, nukes are really only effective if destruction is your primary goal, and while that’s a side effect of war it is rarely the purpose. Russia wants Ukraine for the land and resources; turning it into a nuclear wastelast would make it worthless. Any of the tactical uses you mentioned can be accomplished by precision bombing. (Check out audiobook Bomber mafia if this is a topic that interests you). 

Lastly there’s also a question of optics. A country can have plausible deniability that they didn’t intend to hit civilians, and generally do try to avoid civilians simply because doing so isn’t worth tarnishing international reputation and risking other countries getting involved economically or militarily. Using WMDs is needlessly destructive and is a sure fire way to have other countries start meddling",0

The earth is a horrible heat conductor. If it were good at it, we wouldn't have constant temperatures a few feet down. You can have an entire winter of sub-freezing temps and it won't cool the earth off below the frost line of the area.

Geothermal works well because the ground can store the heat in the summer and pull from it in the winter. When you design commercial buildings, you actually have modeling programs that tell you how closely your wells can be before you end up with ""interference"" from adjacent wells.

If you have a dense area of wells in a very cooling dominated area like the southern US, you can absolutely raise local ground temps to the point the systems don't work. I've seen it firsthand in schools that have installed them. They have to bring in cooling towers now because the ground has become too hot locally for the well fields to reject heat int he summer.",1

"For your second point I have a lot. First with your black men point. It is a well known fact that socially a black male is more likely to commit a crime than a white one, and the severity of the crime is on average worse. We could get into a debate on the reason why but I will save that for another time. White men are also executed more than black men (see here https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/executions-overview/executions-by-race-and-race-of-victim). This wasn’t my main point but I thought I provided an argument against your point about feelings.

Secondly, about your point on rape, 91% of victims are women, and that means only 9% are men. This is only victims, I’m sure almost all 91% of those women were rapes by men, and at least 2/3 of those men were raped by men. The point is that you don’t hear about women raping, because they rarely, rarely happen in contrast to men.

My last point goes on your 3rd last paragraph. If you have a person on death row, it’s normally for a very terrible crime. Specifically mass murder, rape, ect. These acts get tons of media attention, and I’m sure many experiments and theory’s are developed on why these people do such horrendous things. But if we keep them alive, then the punishment is much more appealing than death, which could push these people further into executing their thoughts.

Sorry, this is my last point. Take Jeffery Dalmer. Jeffrey Dalmer killed I believe dozens of people, which is horrifying! Regardless, he was sentenced to life. In the end he was beat to death by inmates, justified. If you were in his shoes would you rather die a quick death, or get brutally beaten? Maybe this argument supports yours, because I think that the sentence should reflect the person. A person like Jeffrey Dalmer didn’t care about dying, his only joy was torturing others, which he continued to do in prison, in that case he should have been executed.",0
"A few thoughts:

* This argument is almost always based on a false choice logical fallacy: That we have to choose one or the other. We can solve homelessness AND explore our solar system at the same time.
   * Look at NASAs budget vs the US military budget. NASAs budget is 1/50th of the military budget. If saving money is really your aim, you're not starting where the waste really lies.
* The cool thing about ""abstract knowledge"" is that it pays back in ways you don't expect. Research for a particular technology is fine, but sometimes just trying to do something uncovers some really valuable things.
* Fallout from the space efforts so far:
   * Solar panels
   * Heart monitors
   * Light weight materials
   * Water purification systems
   * Miniaturization
* If you want specifics:
   * Memory foam
   * Cordless tools
   * Infrared ear thermometers
   * Cochlear implants
   * Lidar
   * Scratch resistant lenses
   * Space blankets
   * and a lot more.
* NASA largely pays for itself. Its budget in 2024 was about $25 billion. Its economic impact was estimated at $75 billion for the same year. It's estimated that Apollo paid back $7 to $8 for every dollar spent on it.
* For Americans specifically: Pulling back on pure research and work in space is most decidedly not the way to go about maintaining a dominant economic position.
* This is not even touching on (admittedly speculative) future benefits if we figure out how to drag a mineral rich asteroid into Earth orbit.",1

I'm not even saying we shouldn't progress technologically, I'm just saying history (especially recent history) has shown we don't fully understand this shit and the consequences it has on the world, so maybe we should actually study this shit for a while before we just dump it into society.

"&gt;I am of the opinion that the CHIPS and Sciences Act was unnecessary or at least should have been amended as some Democratic senators suggested so that the chips companies receiving the subsidies didn't turn around and use the federal money on buybacks and dividends.


The CHIPS Act does explicitly prohibit government funds from being used for buybacks and dividends. It also prohibits companies from expanding foreign investment. While companies are not completely restricted from using non-government funds for buybacks / dividends, as that would likely completely deter them from pursuing these government grants, they are required to submit 5-year buyback / dividend plans in their applications, which affects the funding and restrictions on the funding they receive. The CHIPS act also includes a bunch of other requirements regarding worker incentives and protections, profit-sharing, and has already resulted in semiconductor companies announcing a bunch of new domestic projects. So, I'm confused on what specifically you find problematic with the CHIPS Act that isn't completely unrealistic, or a non-starter.


&gt;Speaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&amp;D).


Expecting Biden to be able to pass a much larger tax on stock buybacks is just wishful thinking that ignores the incrementality of progressive legislation, and the reality of a partisan congress this legislation needs to go through.",0

So in recognition that a human did work you credit that person, as much as its also good to send people who like the art their way.

"I rethought a lot of it overnight and did not give enough credence to ""professors are still people and they do put their opinions into their work and departments, over time, can self select for a homogeny in thought."" At the same token though, that's how you end up with ""xyz is considered the best ___ program in the country / world.""




On ""sacred cows and unpopular opinions"" I come back to ""shit, my words do matter"" but would extend it with ""and if I raise an opinion, by virtue of expression, I am now open to criticism, *and that's fair*"". If you're going to go for a sacred cow, be up for the challenge; as an example, really only in America is Economics as a discipline cast solely through the lens of Capitalism as the only rational economic system - suggesting that other systems might have merits or *gasp* be better, is considered attacking a sacred cow. You might engage with other economic theories in political science(e.g. studying Marxism) or sociology, or philosophy, but it's actually uncommon to do so within an Economics department in America. 




On the cross disciplinary side, I'd expand my argument to consider that academic fields are increasingly specialized, and in humanities especially, there is a large historical corpus that must often be studied such that you can contextualize the overall historical intellectual development of a subject, not to mention how analytical frameworks and schools of thought have evolved. As time goes on, I think it just becomes harder and harder because there's simply more within every subject to take in. 




Adding something else - I think one thing that's missed in the debate is that academia and going deep on a topic means that you actually can't apply ""common sense"" thinking to a topic the more advanced you become in it - you're advancing the understanding and knowledge so that what you do / study might eventually become common sense before eventually that common sense gets replaced by a new common sense on a subject. It's kind of the point, I think?

Numerous Jewish groups joined the march. They marched as Jews to show their opposition to the state of Israel, which for 66 years has endlessly stolen Palestinian land and imposed the most brutal occupation and siege on Palestinians. Jewish marchers saying “not in my name” included, the Jewish Bloc, The International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Jews for Justice for Palestinians and Jews Against the war on Gaza.

"but carbon dioxide is not pollution - its literally the stuff of life. plastics, chemical, pollution - i agree 100% - but not co2. the more the better - literally.



for some reason co2 has been seized upon and the 'big bad' - when its nothing of the sort. Water vapour contributes over 75% of the observed ghe, and its claimed that co2 contributes between 20-25% - however there is no actual data on this - its just claimed. in fact actual calcs show total co2 emitted by humans amounts to about just 5% of total co2 emissions [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-024-05896-y](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-024-05896-y)

and the water vapour thats in the atmosphere - that emits 85X more radiation than co2 does

[https://www.scirp.org/pdf/ijg\_2024032514494686.pdf](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/ijg_2024032514494686.pdf)



And of the co2 thats emitted per year, it lasts about 4years in the atmosphere before it's reabsorbed

[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ef200914u](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ef200914u)



But as trees and vegetation, and all life needs co2, and the alarmists are claiming too much co2 is bad - that leaves us to understand, there must be an optimal amount of co2.

the most growth observed in nurseries and greenhouses where they inject co2, is around 1400ppm.

the atmosphere is currently about 420ppm, and the alarmists are claiming we must not be higher than 1.5x the preindustrial co2, which was around 280ppm (note all vegetation starts dying at around 180ppm and below, so 280 is actually pretty low, considering that optimal plant growth occurs at a concentration of 5X higher.)

so 1.5 x 280ppm = 420ppm - which is where we are right now - but that is still 3.3 x lower than the prefered co2 level of growing plants",1

"The math behind your carbon calculations is overly simplistic and ignores crucial factors that actually make these policies climate-positive in the long run.

Take immigration: Migrants from developing countries often bring innovative solutions and entrepreneurial mindsets. Many cleantech founders in the US are immigrants. Restricting immigration would literally keep potential climate solution creators out of the ecosystem where they can have the most impact.

Your residential zoning point actually argues against itself. Dense, mixed-use development is exactly what we need - and many new developments are embracing this model. Look at projects like Culdesac in Phoenix: zero-parking, mixed-use, walkable communities. The problem isn't new development, it's outdated NIMBY policies preventing it.

On children: The people who care most about climate tend to have fewer kids naturally. By arguing against having children, you're ensuring that future generations will be raised by people who don't prioritize climate action. We need educated, climate-conscious people raising the next generation of engineers and scientists who will solve these problems.

RTO is the easiest to debunk. Companies are increasingly powering offices with renewable energy at a scale impossible for individual homes. My own office building runs 100% on solar and uses efficient central HVAC that beats individual home systems.

The solution isn't to stop having kids or ban immigration - it's to push for systemic changes that make all these activities more sustainable. Your approach is like trying to solve obesity by telling everyone to stop eating, instead of fixing the food system.",1

"Part of why it's so expensive is due to overregulation, for a generation the rulebooks have been written by people who pretty literally wanted to regulate it to death.

Even ignoring that potential to make it cheaper, whenever power has to come from a battery it will be more expensive than coming from a nuclear plant. Generously assuming 200USD per KWH on a pack + infrastructure level, no maintenance costs and 3000 full cycles battery life, that is still almost 7 cents per KWH.

However you will need a lot of batteries that only discharge once a year, in january and frebruary. Even if those work for 75 years that is still 3 USD per KWH. You will also need a multiple of the needed amount of solar and wind installed to make sure you have energy on cloudy and not particularly windy days, completely messing up your economics once you go over about around 50% of the total annual energy need on the grid level. The real choice is, aside from hydro/geothermal which are better than other options when available: 60% wind/solar (summer 95% winter 25%) with batteries and 40% fossil (5% summer and 75% winter) vs. 30% wind/solar, (40% summer 10% winter), 60% nuclear and 10% fossil (0% summer and 30% winter). The second option has a much better total carbon and resource use footprint.",1
"I'm not a climate expert, and I'm not particularly catastrophic on any California hurricane risks. But if the Pacific jumps a few more degrees, I think rainfall in those latitudes should jump - like they have for the last couple years of warmer ocean temps.

And here it is, in the introduction:

&gt; Estimates of the magnitude of the effect of a gradual animal agriculture phaseout and global shift to a plant-based diet are based on research quantifying the full climate opportunity cost of current global animal agriculture production including progressive reduction in livestock production, emissions, and full biomass recovery, with full benefits realized gradually over the century

Pretty much the argument I expected it would be. There are direct emissions from animal agriculture, but then there's also the opportunity cost. So all the land wasted on raising livestock and growing feed for livestock could be sequestering enormous amounts of carbon if it were allowed to be rewilded.

USA is 250 years old and during its own peak infrastructure building phase would have surpassed most of these companies and then some in emissions (as also noted in this article).

Idiotic to put the same guardrails on countries which are in their growing phase compared to countries which have fully grown and are over 150 years old on average. Also, these countries also have the largest populations in the world.

USA is an outlier in this list (and could easily implement green policies due to its massive wealth and general scale of industralization) but under Trump will not regulate fossil fuel consumption at all but it is unfair to lump countries and companies in the global south to the same standards as countries in the West which a) are older (USA 250 to China and India's 70 some years old) b) are poorer and c) are a lot more populated.

"Given that insulation can reduce your energy usage by 40% - 50%; unless you're able to finance a solar insulation that offsets more than that, you'd better improve your carbon footprint with insulation.

Relative to electric heaters, heat pumps save 60-80% on heating so that's the next thing. 

IMO only once you've dialed in your energy usage by making your house efficient, solar+batteries are worth exploring.

That said, I haven't checked recently, but a few years back insulation was way cheaper to install than solar. That might have changed now and it could be more cost effective to throw an abundance of panels at an inefficient house haha",1

"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

From the article: Western Digital has launched a large-scale hard disk drive recycling initiative in partnership with Microsoft, Critical Materials Recycling, and PedalPoint Recycling. The program, called the Advanced Recycling and Rare Earth Material Capture Program, aims to tackle a longstanding problem in the tech industry: the loss of valuable rare earth elements and other critical materials when data center drives reach the end of their lifecycle and are typically destroyed, generating significant e-waste.

Although solid-state drives have become the standard for personal computers, mechanical hard drives remain the backbone of data centers worldwide. When these drives are retired, they are often shredded for data security, and their components – ranging from aluminum and steel to rare earth magnets – frequently end up in landfills.

The environmental cost is further compounded by the fact that mining new rare earth elements such as dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium is highly energy-intensive and produces substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Adding to the challenge, China, which dominates global rare earth material production, has recently imposed export restrictions on several key materials, threatening the supply chain for US technology companies.

Western Digital's program aims to reclaim critical materials domestically. The process begins with collecting end-of-life drives from Microsoft's US data centers, which are then shredded and sorted by PedalPoint Recycling. The extracted magnets and steel are sent to CMR, where an acid-free dissolution recycling technology recovers rare earth elements. This copper salt-based process selectively leaches out rare earth oxides with remarkable purity (up to 99.5 percent) while avoiding the harsh chemicals that can damage rare earths and other valuable metals like aluminum.

The pilot program has already diverted approximately 47,000 pounds of hard drives, SSDs, and mounting caddies from landfills or less effective recycling streams. According to Western Digital, the process has recovered over 90 percent of the rare earth elements and about 80 percent of all shredded material by mass.

Double bullshit. Public transport is not supposed to make any profit, it's to serve the public, and you get to use it for free cause you already paid for it with your tax, if your government tells you otherwise then it means they mismanage the money, which is not surprising

Yes the Biosphere will survive, we are headed in an extiction event the scale of which we dont know. Browd ecosystem wide studies do show that nearly everyspecies is in decline.

Also, we do have quite a few species that have adapted to human conditions, so it's not like evolution is just not working at fast pace.

A total of zero species have exhibited biological adaptation to humans, a few have shown biological selection changes in respknse to changes in environment. There have also been behavioral adaptation for species but these are not related to evolution these are with the framework of their existing social norms. The one exception I can think of might be domestic cats, which are velieved to be the only self domesticating species, but we dont have a baseline species to compare to.

Like many animals they don’t breed well in captivity, but I haven’t seen any evidence that they breed poorly in the wild. You seem to be saying that they would be dying out without human influence causing environmental chance and habitat destruction, but I don’t see any evidence cited of that.

"I've experienced this myself. 

As it comes to calculating emissions when flying, there are several effects some calculators consider:
- net co2 emissions
- particle emissions (NOx etc)
- H2O (condensation trails)

Net co2 is basically considered in every calculator, the way how it is calculated may differ but in average these numbers should match somewhat, since it's mostly the distance and the plane type. Also consider there may be different engine types on the same model, (747-400 vs 747-800 for example) which has quite an impact on fuel consumption/co2.

The other effects esp also heating effect due to condensation trails can amount to increasing the ""heating effect"" of a flight by a factor if &gt;2x. In how much they are factored in into the calculations really depends on the calculator itself. I have seen a calculator that has mapped these effects to a CO2 ""effective value"" which turned out to be a lot higher than the raw co2 value.

The complicated aspect is that condensation trails do not always appear and/or could be avoided by modifying flight levels or routes. Hence it's not really simple to use this as a metric, I would first try to compare via the net co2 emissions only. Also airlines do typically state the expected co2 for a certain flight segment, I've seen this online on several flight comparison sites.",1

A lot of fossil fuel companies have expressed interest in ""green"" tech, but in a way that allows them to continue using their existing infrastructure. This could help with that, especially if it can be used in the trucking industry.

"I'm not sure of the extent of Australia's situation, but, there's generally a few things nuclear does really well. Grain of salt here, I can't source all of this. I've worked in the naval nuclear space as a chemist and have done personal research including research for a BS of nuclear science technology. So also, probably biased. However,

1. Nuclear's capacity factor is unmatched by any legacy or renewable energy source, resting in the low 90%. Coal and gas are around 50%, solar and wind are around 20-30%, and geo is upper 70%, if I'm recalling correctly. Capacity factor is a measure of how often a generator is producing rated power over a period of time. A year for instance, would have solar producing its max output only 20-30% of the time, while nuclear would be at max output 92% of the time. 

This is the 'baseload' discussion, that nuclear can stay on all the time and provide the majority of the minimum continuous power demand. If your grid usage drops to 60% at night, nuclear can provide most of the energy for that demand, while during the day, other energy can be turned on as needed. 

2. Land usage. Nuclear has one of, if not the lowest, life time land usage requirements of all energy sources. Per unit of power (KW, MW, GW) nuclear needs less land than others to provide it. That includes land considerations for mining, waste disposal, and operations not just the actual power plants. This allows for easier placement in optimal locations as it won't interfere as heavily with adjacent land. Yes, the adjacent land would fall under different emergency measures in the case of radioactive release, but this a very, and I mean, incredibly small, risk. Land adjacent can still be used, and because it produces zero carbon during operation, the surrounding area is very clean minus the roads to get in.

3. Cost reduction by direct replacement. Nuclear capacity factor means it directly competes with thermal, hydro, and fossil fuels, and does it better, it's just expensive. It is expensive, and there's many reasons why that I'm not sure Australia shares with the U.S. Our primary issue, that you WILL face, is lack of experience in construction. The Vogtle nuclear stations were massively over budget and behind schedule, however, this is the second and third reactor finished in the U.S. (outside military) since 1990. They are also new designs, which caused some issues. Basically, the construction company assigned had very little practical experience with building the things, and this causes mistakes, and cost creep. Westinghouse, the designer of the plants, also declared bankruptcy during construction and caused a whole wealth of problems. 

Cost is still high, but it doesn't have to be nearly as bad, and can even be cost competitive with at least fossil if not even some more expensive renewables. The high capacity factor, coupled with its small physical plant footprint, permits nuclear to directly replace fossil fuel installations at a 1-1 or 1-2 ratio. A lot of cost is in land and that land ready for a power station, additional funds from surrounding infrastructure also boost prices. If nuclear were to directly replace just retired fossil fuel power stations, or even active ones, you can use a lot of the preexisting infrastructure. More importantly, you don't have to spend massive amounts on land and land development. Because of the small footprint, each fossil fuel power station may be capable of more than 1 nuclear reactor. This is pretty important, as building multiple reactors in one location *generally* will cost less than building 2 at 2 different locations.

---
The ability to directly replace can reduce costs, some (definitely biased) people claim as high as 60% reductions. I'm skeptical, but even a 25% reduction would be significant. 

Other methods such as plant standardization can reduce costs. Specifically for part to part usage, and more importantly reactor certification. Many reactors are *based* on a design, but are all custom built to some extent. This requires custom certification of each power station, which cost overhead in creation and execution. 

Leaving them on longer also reduces costs. This is also why I think direct replacement has such potential. When you refuel and Overhaul a reactor to double its life span, the refueling process is a fraction of the cost of initial construction. All of the existing infrastructure is there and the land is made specifically for that plant. This already exists and has been done multiple times, and it's always cheaper than initial construction and spreads the cost out across more years. 

A 21 billion cost 30 yr plant is 700 mil/yr, but if you refuel that reactor at th 30 yr mark for only 9, 12, or even 14 billion, your yearly cost is 500, 550, or 583 million per year. These aren't accurate, just examples, some will be higher some have been significantly lower. Direct replacement could have a similar effect to reduce costs.

Other reasons: 

Australia will soon have a nuclear submarine force. Australia will spend *a lot* of money just training operators how to operate. These individuals, upon exiting will have no plants to take their experience to, and will probably shift careers or work at conventional power stations. The difference in cost in training someone for nuclear vs conventional, adds up. No idea what specific figures would be, but for my training it (allegedly) cost around 200k, and Google AI says 'several hundreds of thousands'.

In addition to the operators, the cost of regulatory bodies for military nuclear can be spread across civil sector as well.

The submarines will require extensive maintenance under radiological conditions. Specialized civil workforce, same as operator argument.

Renewables will also require significant battery capacity, which does help with capacity factor, but will be expensive. Batteries don't last, and continuously recycling and procuring more will be expensive long term. This will potentially also constitutes worse waste production than nuclear, as the toxicity is high for many battery types. Battery creation, is also very environmentally damaging (for some types). Examples would be the lithium extraction fields in Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Generally, it requires a lot of water that can't be used again for other things.

Lastly, time. We need to rapidly change energy *now*. That seems counter to nuclear, as it takes so long to build, however, if we start soon, we can get significant portions of national grids supplied by 2050 which would directly replace active carbon emitters. We are already at 1.5C as of this year, energy demand is increasing and we are using *more* fossil fuels as it does. We need all hands on deck, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, etc. need to be built fast to mitigate CC. Renewables simply cannot do it fast enough, Australia could help by building nuclear *and* renewables.",1

"&gt;If you follow any moral logic down the rabbit hole you will always fall into a circular logic.

That's because morality is inherently subjective. There is no way to objectively show that something is moral, it necessarily always comes down to an individual's feelings and opinions.

But that's the problem with this argument that God created morality so what he says is moral is truly moral, Christians use this as a way to try and make morality objective. It doesn't really work because at best they're just redefining morality to mean ""what God says"" which is still inherently subjective.

If you can't prove one way or another that a statement is true or false, the reasonable thing is to withhold your belief until there is a way to find out if its actually true, and not just accept that it's true based on faith. You don't have to accept that it's false either, just don't accept that it's true.",1

"By Jeff Young - Environment and Sustainability Editor: 

As his final weeks in the White House wind down, President Joe Biden and his top aides are making a home-stretch sprint on climate action, finalizing multibillion-dollar clean-energy loans, supporting state-level action on EVs and setting a new national target for greenhouse gas reductions.

""I'm proud to announce an ambitious new goal: cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60 percent by 2035,"" Biden said in a video statement released by the White House Thursday. The new target to control carbon pollution from across the economy is the latest U.S. commitment to meet targets in the international Paris Agreement on climate change.

"&gt;And yeah I do think it's incredibly shitty that people are using it to circumvent hiring an actual artist for their games / projects. I do still think most of it still looks like slop but it is getting better and I really don't know what that is going to mean for human creativity in the future. Being an artist in our society was hard enough without having to compete with actual robots.

I really don't understand this. You realize that the AI needs external human input just like digital, pencils, paintbrushes, chisels or stamps do. The only difference is that art is now more accessible for millions of people who don't have fine motor skills but can now express their creativity without the very specific and niche experience of having an interest in art supported and developed from a young age. It's a good thing that far more of the world has had the barrier to being an artist lowered and you still have to have the skills and finesse to get the desired outcome out of the AI. It's just a different skillset just like a great painter is not automatically great with sculpting.

I'm kinda sick of the ludditeism towards AI art. Let's say what we all really mean: Artists are MOSTLY upset that their highly exclusive and elitist hobby/job has been commodified and that their club isn't exclusive anymore. These are the same people who said *learn to code* when the coal plants shut down a decade ago. Why do you think it deserves any greater esteem or protection then a shift to clean energy?

What does children being born out of hospitals 100 years ago have to do with today. Are you saying china's health care for maternity patients is lower than sub Sahara Africa?



So I am to believe that according to the voting system on reddit, the predominant theory on reddit is not that mathematically china's population is smaller than reported, but rather that 10% of china's population was born in a shed and lives under false identity somehow entered into the national database with they're lineage altered and this has flown under the radar of the Chinese federal government . Not even good propaganda bud


Truly an organic thought process not directed by propaganda to cover up the fact that if china's population is smaller it means that their military by proxy is also smaller and their labor force is no longer a good investment long term 


But if it is true that also means.


1) the CCP is so riddled with corruption that virtually anyone can bribe the government 


2) the CCP is so incompetent that it doesn't notice 10% or more of its records to be fabricated fraudulently


3) the CCP is vulnerable to spys on a shocking level of it's so easy and cheap to bypass they're national if system 


4) china allows certain citizens to secretly have children while not others to carry out the slow ethnic genocides of Chinese minorities the CCP denies it is partaking in

Plus billions of dollars for promoting off label uses. And billions of dollars and illegal kickback schemes. And these are just the ones that have actually made it through the court system. What else are these companies doing wrong?

All that information is factual. Vaccines are made by Pharma companies and most scientifically literate people support them. And, Pharma companies have been embroiled in hundreds of billions of dollars of damages due to unethical practices that have worsened the lives of millions of people.

"It is a well known fact that climate change is caused by humans. Let’s look at the evidence:

1. CO2 causes warming. This is easy to prove. You can look up tabletop experiments you can try in your kitchen. Tl;dr is that CO2 absorbs light and release it as heat. 

2. Humans are the main source of CO2. We know this because CO2 picks up as the Industrial Revolution began, which is when we started combustion billions of tons of carbon rich materials that used to be locked in long-term geologic storage. We know this from measuring gas bubbles in ice cores. We know exactly what was in the air for the past few thousand years. 

3. The only modeling and uncertainty is where the climate is going. But those models are really good. In fact, the climate models are so good that major petroleum companies used to use them to predict where to find fossil fuel deposits (while funding climate denial campaigns). 


In terms of one figure, I don’t think there’s one that will convince them. Mauna Loa shows a persistent, increasing rate of CO2 in the atmosphere. ShowYourStripes shows persistent increased tropospheric temperatures. If I had to pick one, I’d do this one from [New Scientist that shows air and sea surface temperatures](https://images.app.goo.gl/nAWB8sEXZ8gTw7sS8) for the past few years (notice how similar those temperature curves are to CO2!). 

I work in industrial decarbonization and it’s remarkable how many companies who used to say climate change isn’t real are now pouring billions of dollars into climate technologies. All the petroleum majors flipped their messaging as soon as they acquired the patents for/parent companies of carbon capture, direct air capture, hydrogen fuels, and renewable fuels/synthetic chemistry. Maybe a figure showing the petroleum majors’ investments in climate tech might be more effective!",1

"The amount of [carbon dioxide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/forest-fire-heat-carbon-absorb/) in the atmosphere last year grew at the fastest rate in recorded history — a dramatic spike that scientists fear may indicate that Earth’s ecosystems are so stressed by warming they can no longer absorb much of the pollution humanity emits.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Global Monitoring Laboratory on Monday [released data](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/gl_gr.html) showing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by 3.75 parts per million in 2024. That jump is 27 percent larger than the previous record increase, in 2015, and puts atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at a level not seen [in at least 3 million years.](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide)

Though the vast majority of planet-warming gases come from people burning fossil fuels, a separate study released Tuesday suggests that last year’s sudden spike was likely driven by a different force: the deterioration of rainforests and other land ecosystems amid soaring global temperatures.

Because this is an excellent example of what looks like science-based objections to the claim that we are in a crisis, but in fact fails on every point.

In fact…

1. The actual models have proven remarkably accurate.

2. 99% of actual climate scientists concur that climate change is driven by human activity. And if we want to talk funding-related bias, look no further than climate scientists who are members organizations like the Association of American Petroleum Geologists. This is a great example of scientists who are doing poor science because their salaries are at stake.

3. Not only was the 97% accurate, it is now in the 99% range according to meta studies of papers on the subject. Cornell university found that 99.9% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is mainly caused by humans, according to a new survey of 88,125 climate-related studies.

4. Climate change is obviously also a natural process, which is why we see it elsewhere in the solar system and prior to the industrial period.

"A day on Venus can be measured in two ways: a solar day lasts about 116.75 Earth days, while a sidereal day, which is the time it takes for Venus to complete one full rotation on its axis, is about 243 Earth days.

&gt; In a stunning display of nature’s efficiency, a family of European beavers has accomplished in two days what the Czech government had struggled to do for seven years. The project to restore wetlands in Brdy Nature Park, launched in 2018, faced numerous bureaucratic hurdles, from obtaining permits to resolving land ownership disputes. Despite an estimated cost of 30 million Czech crowns, progress was slow—until the beavers stepped in.

&gt; Environmentalists monitoring the Brdy area were astonished to find that the beavers had instinctively built a series of functional dams in the exact locations necessary for wetland restoration. Their work not only eliminated the need for human intervention but also saved the government millions. Zoologist Jiri Vl?ek emphasized the stark contrast, stating, “Beavers can build a dam in one night, two nights at the most, while humans spend years on paperwork and approvals.”

The continents also drift a few millimeters every year, which adds up to no small amount of surface mass. The mechanism of continental drift involves the movement of large amounts of molten mass within the mantle that periodically results in volcanic activity

"The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

---

From the article: Recent tests have proven that beaming solar energy to Earth from low-orbiting satellites is theoretically possible with existing technology. If implemented, the method could resolve several flaws of conventional solar panels, providing a continuous source of renewable energy while occupying minimal space.

Researchers from Japan Space Systems (JSS) recently beamed energy wirelessly from a speeding jet to antennae on the ground. The successful experiment confirms the viability of numerous tools that might eventually transmit solar power from space to Earth.

Low-orbit solar panels that beam energy to the surface have multiple advantages over ground-based solar farms. Without interference from the Earth's atmosphere, they can collect several times more energy. The arrays would send power to Earth in the form of microwaves, which lose only five percent of their energy when passing through the atmosphere.

Furthermore, maintaining proper orbit enables the transmission of solar energy at night, ensuring an uninterrupted, round-the-clock supply. Scientists theorize that solar energy from space might supplement the energy needed to power various land and air vehicles, further reducing carbon emissions. Ground-based receivers would also cover far smaller areas than typical solar or wind farms.

However, some obstacles remain. Significant amounts of energy are lost during conversion to and from microwave emission. Furthermore, all artificial satellites must deal with micrometeorites and the prospect of creating space debris. Some also theorize that orbital microwave emitters could become weapons of mass destruction.

It becomes really difficult to just find yourself in the present. But thats the single largest thing you should shoot for.

They are doing awful things, and making awful choices, for the sake of themselves and their friends. A lot of shit could go very badly.

  
and heres the other tough part: outside of very few specific moments in human history, this has always been true. The people who are searching out political, economic, or other powers over other human beings, are typically bad people.

My best answer for dealing with this stuff is: do your best to impact the people around you, and focus on your community. Sure, the leaders in the US are driving us headlong into a death spiral to enrich all the wealthiest. But is there anything you can reasonably do to effect this? Call your reps, call your senators, do what you can, protest when you can, all that stuff is good. But remember you will do way more positives by going to a soup kitchen to help people in need close by your home. Help friends with projects on the weekend, support a little local restaurant with your dollars instead of a national fast food chain, volunteer for a park cleanup in your neighborhood. 

The only way I have found to counter the dread is to forcibly do ANYTHING positive in which ways you can. Some people are born with money, and connections, or the opportunity to actually shape how stuff works. The rest of us random people are just trying to get by, but you can help your neighbors when they need it, and it will help you to feel better about life.

"&gt;No, if he had succeeded then Joe Biden would never have been president.

This is what is really inconsistent with your argument.

You're making a claim that Trump had all the power but stepped aside, while simultaneously claiming previously you're worried about him using the military/police to prevent someone else from being in power.

It doesn't logically make sense. It didn't happen last time he was in charge. It's not anymore likely or more evidence it's going to happen.

It's a catch-22, your claiming he both will and when presented with the past and evidence where he didn't.

&gt;  
Also, consider context for a hot second. The drone strike to which you refer was stated to be accidental.

So it's ok to kill someone accidentally avoiding due process? It's not whataboutism, I'm pointing otu that it's been the law of the land forever and was upheld as the law of the land. Nothing changed. It was fine and no one was really concerned when it happened because the president is defacto immune from prosecution for official acts and it was never challenged before until the Democrats broke the status quo and took it to court against Trump. Which forced a SCOTUS ruling.

&gt;  
Next, there is a BIG difference between the implication that the president can get away with some potentially unlawful acts and a Supreme Court decision giving an explicit blanket immunity for an undefined set of unlawful acts.

This is just a gross mischaracterization of the actual ruling. I'd suggest you actually read the ruling from the [SCOTUS.gov](http://SCOTUS.gov) website. 

&gt;Do you not see the mental gymnastics you are pulling off here to justify this?

Wouldn't you agree people sometimes speak in metaphors? It's common speech. My interpretation is by no means a stretch of the imagination.

On the Office of Special Council guy. Literally, every president has the right to appoint people. But for some reason people are upset with Trump's appointments.

For example, from your article, ""Dellinger, who was appointed to his post last year by President Joe Biden""

So can Trump not appoint his own Office of Special Council? The President is responsible for something like 1500 appointments. It's an appointed position not an elected one.

&gt;Courts are meaningless if the president will not follow them. He has already blatantly defied court orders to return the prisoners interned in El Salvador.

This just reads again like someone who is complaining without real substance. The system works by litigating it in court. Until it's decided it's unclear is any laws are broken. The administration has largely followed all court orders. It's debatable the authority of the judges orders in those case, so they are being challenged. It's being litigated right now. If it's ruled they need to bring the people back they will bring the people back. That's how the courts work. You can't just say it's meaningless when you don't like the rulings. Which is pretty much what you're doing.",0

"And you see, even in these short statements, you can find the usual propaganda. 

1) The time frame. Actually mutations happen in a short time, there is no difference in time frames fro genetic modification and spontaneous mutations. This is one of the usual misconceptions, that ""traditional breeding"" is slow and steady while genetic engineering is fast. No such distinction exists. Mutations happen instantly, it is simply slower to stabilize a strain if you have to backcross it to the parental strain for ten years in a row just to get the original phenotype with the new, desired gene if you are working with a random method. That will not change that when you are using the new strain it will be novel for your field however it has been made.

3) Is a freebie.

4) Is usually not debated. Anyone is fine with scientists doing something in the lab. 

5) This is totally a propaganda point, an example of lying by omission. Is there a method of breeding where we have ""full understanding of biochemical reactions""? So is there a method that is free from ""unanticipated effects""? Then how is this specific for GMOs? Actually we do not know what happens in a plant genome during breeding, anything and everything can happen. Actually ""traditional breeding"" is more dangerous in that sense, you use gigabases of unknown DNA for that, which can hold any surprising elements, dormant viruses, domesticated transposons, new enzymes producing novel metabolites, etc. How do you know that crossing wheat to some goatgrass freshly found at the Black Sea will not unleash an old wheat virus that decimates crops? Genetic engineering avoids this inherent risk by simply not using a huge amount of unknown DNA only very limited gene cassettes, with known DNA sequence. If we keep the last example, there is zero chance that inserting a gene cassette into the wheat genome will unleash a dormant virus, as we can be absolutely sure that the gene cassette does not contain one. While the goatgrass genome can harbor any evolutionary sediment. 

Add to that that GMOs have an approval process, while whatever you create by ""traditional breeding"" can be used anywhere without any safety trials or approvals. Whatever is bred without genetic engineering will reach your plate without any in vitro testing. In this sense GMOs are much-much better than anything else on the market. Quite the opposite to your statement. 

6) What does most of society process the scientific literacy to be able to assess? An electric car? Would you say a lot of people know the dangers of batteries? Can distinguish between different battery chemistries? Or a smartphone? Powered flight? A vaccine? 5G networks? Or anything else? This is again a strange take, I would wager that the average citizen is incapable of assessing the risks associated with every technology he uses. Especially plant breeding, see point 5)! But then why single out GMOs? 

7) Again, a nice take on horses and glyphosate. But what does it have to do with GMOs? Let me show you an example! I have searched with Google Scholar and could only find a single paper suggesting that horses can be sensitive to glyphosate: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36325641/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36325641/) The study was done in the Veterinary University of Leipzig. You know, in Germany. Where not a single bag of glyphosate-resistant plant seed has ever been planted, being in the EU, where no RoundupReady crop was approved ever. So what you were saying about horses and glyphosate? And we can ask so many questions: So horses sensitive to atrazine are not a problem? 

8) What are these corporate strangleholds you mention is passing? You are aware that every new plant variety is treated as intellectual property, its breeder can request plant variety protection for it. Since 1930, so it is not a recent development. Can you explain this ""corporate stranglehold"" in details? Again a propaganda piece, lying by omission. Every new plant variety gets plant variety protection but somehow it is negative for GMOs? Why? 

You see, why this is a problem? Most of these ""everybody knows"" facts are bullshits, or misleading half-truths at best. The problem is, how do you get people to accept that they were wrong on a subject?",1
"I feel like you are engaging with this question in a sort of pedantic way.

You've decided on specific definitions of omnipotence and omniscience and then proved that those definitions don't work. But you can just as easily define your way out of this problem, you can include in your definition of omnipotence the ability to change the rules of logic, and suddenly god can make a stone it can't lift, or you can argue that omnipotence does not include the ability to do logically impossible things. 

Similarly with the omniscience problem, one could subscribe to compatiblism that determinism does not preclude free will, or that the universe is non deterministic and omniscience means knowing everything that could happen and their likelihoods.

None of this is really about the nature of reality or god and much more about what exactly we mean when we say words. This is kind of the inverse to the ontological argument for the existence of god.",0

"It’s a sensitive topic, but I don’t think either is and am curious where you think the bigotry lies?

I think your first point is a slight misrepresentation. The claim isn’t that trans people don’t exist but that the idea of an internal gender identity that we all have (that may or may not match with our biological sex) is an objectively true thing is false. For those who reject the concept, it’s no different to the idea of having a soul. Both are unfalsifiable metaphysical claims. 

Just as denying the existence of souls doesn’t mean you think Christians don’t exist, denying the existence of an internal gender identity doesn’t mean you think trans people don’t exist. And it’s perfectly possible to deny both without being bigoted towards either Christians or trans people. I’m an atheist, but I still believe in freedom of religion. 

Re your second point, that’s just a rejection of the attempt to redefine woman as a term which reflects gender identity over sex. We have a word for the female of many species. Cow, mare, ewe, sow, hen, doe, etc etc. A female human is a woman. Man/woman are terms that donate sex, not how one identifies. Gender (which comes from grammar) is masculine/feminine. 

Bigotry is surely defined by one’s actions, not on ideological conformity.",0

"You’re not wrong to be skeptical of Reddit advice, but you’re blaming the wrong thing. The issue isn’t that Reddit is inherently bad for relationship advice. The issue is that Reddit is a mirror. And sometimes, when people don’t like what they see reflected back, they blame the mirror.

Reddit’s brutal about cheaters. You could cure cancer and still get torched if you admit to cheating once in 2014. And honestly? That makes sense. Betrayal doesn’t just sting... it scrambles your sense of safety. When I was earning my B.S. in clinical psychology, this was something we saw all the time. People don’t just get hurt. They change. Cheating hits that deep.

Sure, Reddit overreacts. Miss one birthday? “Dump them.” But everyone’s dragging their own pain into the comments. It’s a trauma potluck. Some folks offer support. Others throw spaghetti. And a few just bark like emotional raccoons.

Still, there’s gold in the noise. I’ve seen comments open with, “INFO… have you actually talked to them?” That’s emotional literacy. That’s step one in every conflict resolution model I studied (except for one professor who made us meditate with crystals... yeah). The smart stuff’s in there. You just have to dodge the drama.

Also, Reddit doesn’t end relationships. If someone reads a post and realizes they’re miserable, Reddit didn’t ruin them. It just lit the room. The cracks were already there. Sometimes people just need a flashlight and a minute of honesty.

Yeah, advice can come from anyone. A therapist. A 13-year-old who just learned how feelings work. But randomness isn’t unique to Reddit. It’s everywhere. I once asked a coworker if I should move in with someone, and she said, “Only if you’re cool sharing a fridge forever.” Weird advice. But it helped.

Reddit’s like screaming your relationship issues into a karaoke bar. Someone yells “Leave him!” while Bon Jovi’s playing. But listen closely... and someone in the back might say the one thing you actually needed to hear.

So yeah, take Reddit with a grain of salt. Or a Costco tub. But the worst place for advice? Not even close. It’s chaotic, inconsistent, loud... and sometimes the most honest voice in the room.",0

"That’s honestly the ideal situation, right? Just sit down and hash it out until there’s some common ground. I have actually tried this with a close friend of mine who’s a big Trump supporter and self-described libertarian. I brought up how weird it was to support someone who wants more government control over people’s lives while calling yourself anti-big government. Instead of pushing back on policy, he ended up defaulting to “Why would I want a woman to be president?” which had nothing to do with the actual argument.

It’s moments like that where it feels less about facts or logic and more about some underlying bias or an identity thing. I agree there’s value in real conversation, and I always try to start with what we CAN agree on, but sometimes people don’t want to move past their gut feelings or team loyalties. That’s where things break down. Not because the arguments aren’t good enough, but because winning or defending a side feels safer than actually changing your mind.

"&gt;We are still way too divided even in our own countries

And why this is a problem in this context? I mean if you think about ""Human Colony"" as a multinational project like ISS, then yes - that can be a problem. But if you are talking about colonizing other planets in general, then there is no need to overcome division. There can be national colonies or even private colonies - all that is needed are breakthroughs in technology that will bring the costs into more acceptable area. And there are multiple institutions working on that.

&gt;are way too busy trying to prove each other right or superior in any way, that we don't care about our own species and its prosperity

Colonization never happened because of species or prosperity. It happened because of greed, desire to be seen as better and desire to expand your influence. All of those are still there.

&gt;Now? I don't see us going anywhere.

Because you are looking for an idyllic version of human colonization that never existed and never will. You are looking for new pilgrims who are going to New World to make a better country, while this isn't even what happened with original pilgrims or with first colonies.

First colony in New World was Jamestown - which was a company town made for profit and large part of settlers were indentured servants (fancy name for non-chattel slaves). Why first colonies outside Earth would be different? There are resources outside Earth and first colonies will be there to put a flag on them and start to generate profit.

You'd have to explain what the word means (earth-shaped) and even to adults it doesn't really mean much. Telling them it's a circle or it's a sphere allows them to know what shape it is because they can look at other circles and spheres around them. There really is only one geoid though and it's so large you can only see the whole thing if you aren't on it. Maybe I'm living in the past, but last I checked it was impractical to send all toddlers out to space so they can see what the earth looks like.

"But what's the harm of those permanent physical changes if someone doesn't have an inherent gender identity that says ""I am comfortable with X sexed characteristics and not with Y sex characteristics""?

If a woman mistakenly believes she's trans, takes testosterone for a year or two and has her breasts removed, I can see the harm if she has an inherent 'female' gender identity that makes the effects of testosterone and lack of breasts an unpleasant, mentally challenging experience. If every human being is actually equally fine with having any set of sex characteristics, then growing facial hair, a deepened voice, and not having breasts is not a harm - it's just a change. 

Any harm would be similar to regretting a vasectomy, which obviously can be awful but it's not spoken of in the same vivid gory detail as the apparent nightmare trauma inflicted by altered sex characteristics.",0

"I do agree this problem has been around for a long time. And it does not majorly harm people directly. 

But there are urgent issues which better critical thinking would resolve greatly. Such as people spend a lot of money and time with zodiac signs and beliefs related to them. I feel critical thinking capabilities would help people make better decisions. Make them less susceptible to scams. There are a lot of people who make money using these scams and good people who lose money due to them as well.   
  
My point is having better critical thinking more common and making sure everyone has that would over time improve quality of discussions, better choices made by society, country as a whole. 

I am not against religious beliefs. But certain religious beliefs have grown and changed over time. Such as the round earth theory is accepted by the Church Pope etc but used to not be. Similarly I would like the same to happen with evolution and other scientific proven beliefs. 

With respect to education implementation, I was thinking middle school and high school should have compulsory courses on debate and news. For example a course where people read a news paper and learn about the events that occurred around the world, their relevance, and have structured debates on various topics where they do research, present their points, have rebuttals and so on.

COP is a trust based cooperative effort to reduce emissions.

That's not completely true but that's how it seems. 


At the same time no one is particularly alarmed about foreign emissions, which is where most harm from climate change will come. 


Progressives want to play the cooperative game so they focus on domestic emissions.


Conservatives use foreign emissions as an excuse to keep fossil fuels, but aren't actually concerned about the harm they will cause.

"I would say that I broadly agree with what you're saying, but would say that many people who are accused of using Russian talking points are in fact just making reasonable points and are shouted down for being viewed as sympathetic to Putin for even trying to recognize that the war is more complicated than ""an evil man is evil"".


It is absolutely true that Russia is an expansionist power that attacked Ukraine for trumped up reasons. That said, Ukraine has been moving increasingly close to the West in recent years and that is a serious concern to Russia, in the same way that if Mexico were getting closer to an alliance with China the US would panic. That isn't to say that invading was justifiable, but there's a reason that a lot of reál politique people were saying that this war wasn't particularly surprising. Just like breaking suddenly doesn't justify getting rear ended, but can be a contributing factor to a car crash, the West's overatures to Ukraine were in fact contributing factors to this war even if the fault lies with Russia, and I've been called a Putin lover for saying things like that. 


I think it's true that Russia has absolutely failed in their war aims and been humiliated by this war... But that doesn't change the fact that it's a meat grinder, Ukraine has less meat, and there's really no reason to believe that Ukraine gets out of the war without a loss of territory and so should probably sue for peace -- and should absolutely not listen to any Western country's input on that, because we've been happy to have them do the dying so that Russia loses money and people, even though it would be in their best interest to figure out some sort of peace deal. 


I also do think that Ukraine, despite being the clear moral side in this war, has been weirdly bad at PR -- highlighting Azov battalion Nazis constantly in the early days of the war effort, and recently showing off videos of drones taunting surrendering Russian soldiers before killing them. Really sick shit. I don't even hold a grudge against Ukrainians for wanting to do that shit and for going ""any port in a storm"" when dealing with an invasion, but I find a lot of the western cheerleading of death disgusting.",0

I personally enjoy learning about the bible, and all religions in fact. However i don’t choose to fully devote myself to anything in such regard. I believe we have lost too much of our ancient history to truly know what is the meaning behind 
the creation of the universe. I genuinely believe if there was a way to break down the creation of the universe for humans to understand it, we still could not make sense of it. 

I believe there is always more to learn and uncover, and for that reason specifically; I don’t think my faith could ever be 100% pure. Sure I could lie to myself and say “my religions the only right one!!”, but thats kind of… corny. You think the creator of light and darkness would care about something so pitifully irrelevant when there is no clear conscience answer to any of the questions humans ask, or direction for which faith we should bestow upon which god. 

I think religion a really important part of understanding where we come from, who we are, etc. However, there are about 10,000 different [religions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions), and i think there is value to all of our ancient stories and myths, but we are far from connecting the dots.",1

"Does the economy have to be the number one goal?

Economics is about the distribution of wealth.  Much of wealth just sits around in bank accounts or investment funds that are adding ""paper value"" instead of real value to our society.

The number one goal should be our people and our country (they're the same thing we ARE Canada, not just residents or one of the resources).  Maintaining a number on a spreadsheet should never be more important than the essential needs of the people:  food, shelter, and security.

Putting the economy first means putting the spreadsheets above those essential needs, and is a big part of why we have so much trouble with affordability, even before the lunatic started the global economic crash.

If handled correctly, an economic crash could actually benefit the people by forcing the economy priority down the the spot it's supposed to be in.  We HAVE resources.  We produce food, we produce lumber, we produce steel.  We CAN address our internal needs.  If we step up and do that, but a number on some spreadsheet describing how rich a bunch of people who have never worked an 8-hour day in their life might go down.

Is that number really more important than the people?  A healthy economy is good and useful, but it should never have been allowed past the 4th priority spot.",1

There is no Good over God, for he is goodness itself, and he himself is also perfectly consistent, so there's no fear of goodness suddenly changing (a big problem with God deciding what is good).


I think to make it more concrete is to look at the Trinity, which is God's natural state without particular context, rather than looking at some things he did or decreed within history, which is full of long reasoning or a huge context. In the Trinity there is perfect love between each of his members: the Father honours, adores, and gives authority to the Son, the Son glorifies and perfectly submits to the Father, the Son and the Father give power to the Spirit, and the Spirit acts towards illuminating the Son and the Father. God exists originally and eternally as this trinity, and out of the overflow of the love between these three persons, he creates humanity, a subject upon which he can extend his love further.",1

"I'm struggling with a hypothetical where this would be the case?

   I'm not saying it won't happen but I don't think it's because of the decision overruling chevron. Rather the opposite is likely to be the case.

The original Chevron decision increased executive Authority because it required courts to give deference to an agency interpretation of the law.  If you wanted to challenge a regulation by an executive agency you had to prove that the interpretation was unreasonable.

Overruling Chevron puts that Authority back with the courts.   Courts have substantially more freedom to overrule agency interpretations of the law they were supposed to enforce. 

In the context of environmental law, most of the Battleground was over agency regulations that were seeking to expand the plain language of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.     Overruling Chevron gives industry stakeholders more authority to file legal challenges against executive branch regulations.    

But at the same time it broadens the rights of States to make the same claims. For example in 2007 a number of states filed a lawsuit against the Bush Administration EPA for refusing to regulate carbon dioxide.    The Supreme Court ultimately held that carbon dioxide was a pollutant under the clean air act. 

Trump era conservatives like to Parrot the notion of having clean air and water as the end all be all environmental regulations. That is omitting by inference that the EPA now regulates a lot of things that fall outside of the definition of clean air and water is that tend to piss off landowners and industries.

 The blast pressure did not blast skin of bodies. That damaged was caused by severe 3rd degree burns.

"Not gonna lie, as a white person who was raised Christian, ""Christianity is White People Magic"" is the funniest fucking thing I've heard in a while.

I don't disagree with you: Christianity is 100% ""white people magic""—or ""western culture magic,"" to use the term that I think more accurately describes your point more accurately. (There are, after all, non-white Westerners, non-white Christians, and white people outside of the west and outside of Christianity.)

But I think the part of your view I can change is that you seem to think Christians and/or westerners (""white people"") *don't* consider Christianity to be ""magic."" Any devout Christian would readily agree that their religion requires a belief in the supernatural, or that their beliefs are inherently unscientific. A virgin birth or a resurrection would inherently require supernatural influence. If they believe in that, then they must believe there is some power in the universe that is beyond natural laws (those laws being what the process of science seeks to bring humanity closer to a fuller understanding of). Otherwise, it isn't ""faith"", it's just science.

The deeper question—or at least, the one I find more interesting—is *why* Christians in the west seem to think their religion is somehow more legit or ""less magic"" (to use your terminology) than a witch doctor or a Hindu god or astrology or any other ""less legitimate"" spirituality. I think this is less about why *Christians* think *Christianity* is more legitimate magic, and more about why believers of any religion or spirituality think their own beliefs are more legitimate magic.

And that, I think, is just human nature. If you don't believe a virgin birth is any more possible than a voodoo doll, then you won't believe in the virgin birth any more than you will the voodoo doll. It's the same reason why I think the NY Giants are the best and the Philadelphia Eagles are trash:

"Totally agree government inefficiency is a nightmare—and that example with the light rail is mental. No argument there. The state dragging its feet and blowing budgets isn’t unique to nuclear, but the problem is, nuclear’s one of the worst hit by it because of how complex and politically sensitive it is. Like, if it already takes ages to get big projects off the ground, adding all the safety reg and public scrutiny around nuclear just makes the whole process slower and riskier.

That’s kind of the point I was making—it’s not the *tech* that’s inefficient, it’s everything wrapped around it that ends up making it a long shot when you need quick rollout. So when people say it’s the most efficient, sure, if you're just looking at power output and fuel density, it absolutely is. But if you’re trying to meet global targets fast, and you’ve got to deal with all the mess of politics, public opinion, and massive upfront costs, then nuclear kind of lags behind on *practical* efficiency.",0

"Paperis the most durable way to keep information on a cheap and readily available support. You can record information using a 50cents pen and a paper sheet. Every other mean needs electricity and complex technology.  
There's an emotional perspective too. Writing on paper (to me at least) feels natural and intimate. If you want to keep something secret the only possible way is to keep it on a physical support, hence paper. 
Paper can be used really by anyone without training,  is a good example of built-in skill in our society. You don't need to regulate setting or having compatible devices. You can draw anything of any shape regardless of the quality of your support, instead different graphic tablets might present diverse outcomes. 
It's like paper has been in the world forever.
On line books can be accessed but they are not yours. The only way to HAVE a book is to possess a physical copy that can never be restricted.  If you want is an insurance against censorship orcompanies charging absurd fees just to access a content (a similar concept to DVD vs streaming services)

Furthermore (bonus consideration) paper is essential for personal hygiene.  I don't think we'll get back at using washable rags to wipe our a55e5.

Does it mean we can waste paper at the current rate? Of course not. Just keep in mind paper is a very recyclable material (much more than plastic bottles) and this may mitigate its impact.

They were also much smaller than new houses usually are and had much less safe electrical systems and many had inferior plumbing and so on.

"Several issues -

First, Musk is not a full-time politician. Dems would essentially be wasting legislative days to accommodate Musk's schedule. He is a billionaire who owns several large and high-profile corporations. I doubt he has room in his schedule to jet off to Washington, D.C., for days or weeks at a time. It would only make sense if a handful of Republicans nominate Musk as Speaker of the House, he accepts, and Dems join in to take him across the finish line. However, this would likely alienate their base. After all, they would essentially be elevating a controversial billionaire who owns one of the world's most influential social media companies to a powerful position in government. Every Dem congressman would be handing a primary challenger a major talking point for 2026.

Second, however bad you think Musk and his ideas are, you're essentially granting him *even more* influence over the policymaking process. Closed-door negotiations can get pretty technical and wonky. You're inviting  Musk to have a direct hand in legislative language, specific programs, and so forth. Yeah, he jettisoned the CR Jeffries and Johnson hammered out, that sucks. But there are limits to his pressure campaigns. Musk backed Scott for Majority Leader and lost that battle, for instance. There's no guarantee Republicans will fold on issues where Musk and Dems align. Remember, Musk's influence comes from his ability to tap into and animate Trump's base. Are MAGA Republicans going to follow his beck and whim on EVs and stricter emission standards? Or will they prioritize Americans who work for the oil &amp; gas industry? Who can exert more *individual* pressure on legislators during the primary season - Musk or industry groups representing oil tycoons? 

Third, who the fuck knows what kind of staying power Musk has. Trump is mercurial and so are his most ardent followers and advisors. Six months from now, Musk could be Public Enemy No. 1 and his input might be next to useless. A month from now we might have a completely different Speaker - one who could be a better or worse negotiating partner than Musk.

Finally, Dems have little to gain and much to lose from a cohesive Republican party. GOP chaos benefits Dems politically. If Musk being in the room makes the Republican party more efficient, then that is not a good thing. It's much better for Republicans to be tripping over themselves in intra-party knife-fights and trying to balance a multitude of interest groups in their coalition than working lockstep towards Trump's agenda.",0

Legislation goes all the way back to mid-19th century, it’s hardly anything new. None of the legislation protects the people working in the company from personal liability however:

&gt; Prosecution of a company should not be seen as a substitute for the prosecution of criminally culpable individuals such as directors, officers, employees or shareholders. Prosecuting such individuals provides a strong deterrent against future corporate wrongdoing. Equally, when considering prosecuting individuals, it is important to consider the possible liability of the company where the criminal conduct is for corporate gain.

As many comments suggested, rationalising a Christian’s thought process often is of no sense, since there is no logically consistent thought, that is to be rationalised. It’s what they’ve been taught and thinking is difficult, so they judge. I think there are psychological and historical reasons for especially Christians disliking abortion, not a coherent logic.

&gt;At the federal level, Trump’s push to reduce deployment of technologies like solar panels and wind turbines doesn’t mean that all climate-friendly infrastructure is on the chopping block. His executive orders support construction of new nuclear reactors, geothermal power plants, and facilities to mine and process the minerals like lithium and rare earths that are needed to establish domestic supply chains for batteries and other green-energy equipment. Republican lawmakers have [expressed support](https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-trade-bills-may-get-momentum-under-trump-2/) for using trade policies like carbon tariffs—which would charge levies for imports made with more planet-heating pollution—to cleaner boost domestic industry.

&gt;More controversial climate mitigation technologies could also get funding in the next few years: pipelines and wells to store captured carbon dioxide and even geoengineering tools to cover up the worst effects of warming. Carbon capture is still in its infancy and not considered very reliable or scalable yet, while many researchers and climate advocates consider geoengineering to be unacceptably risky. But in a world where other options are blocked for the next four years, investing in researching these sorts of technologies now could pay off down the road by hopefully buying a future administration some time to clean up the cumulative carbon mess.",1

"&gt;There was a time before capitalism. There will be a time after capitalism. 

Yep, and that time before capitalism was called feudalism.  It was great if you were part of the aristocracy, but not great if you were one of the serfs, who represented about 75% of the population.  They weren't quite considered to be property, like slaves were, but it was close.  When a piece of land was transferred from one owner to another, for example, the serfs were generally considered to be attachments to the land, so they were transferred with the land.  Rights of the individual serf were virtually non-existent compared to what we would think of rights today.

What came before feudalism?  That would be slave-based economies, even in those bastions of western democracy, Rome and Greece.  Their economies were so dependent on slave labor, they would have collapsed without forced servitude.

How far back does this trend go?  To the very first civilization, 7,000 years ago (give or take a century).

[https://pmsancientmesopotamia.weebly.com/social-structure.html](https://pmsancientmesopotamia.weebly.com/social-structure.html)

There's this great myth on the internet, that capitalism is the root of all of the things that are wrong today.  Yeah, sure.  As soon as we started to organize into groups larger than tribes, when populations could be measured in the hundreds or thousands, there was a need for a person or people at the top to coordinate things.  And almost without exception, those with power exploited those without.  Because they could.

The culture war won't end as long as people have grievances with the existing political order. American politics are such that because one side loses, you're mostly going to see them have grievances and so the cycle perpetuates.

While the conservatives have racked up tons of victories and expanded their coalition significantly in the wake of the 2024 election, you're already starting to see some cracks form.

"It doesn't work like you think it does. The end user is the one buying the product which is causing pollution and they should be charged for it.

Your point on alternatives actually makes sense but it's an argument for a carbon tax.

No carbon tax + plane trip = the cost of pollution is hidden or alternatively there is a subsidy to use fossil fuels. Cut it anyway you want too.

Carbon tax + plane trip = the cost of pollution is clear.

Alternatives don't exist either and the market is not making that clear.

"&gt; Handwaving away as some fallacy or bias isn't perticularly powerful as an argument.

But, neither is just bringing up the likelihood of all things that have ever happened and then using that as some form of justification for taking action rather than just assuming it will happen. To be honest, I really don't understand what the argument you're trying to counter with here is, whether it's one about being more optimistic for the future or one directly challenging any of the notions I've brought up in the original post.

&gt; I think the premise of your view is flawed...

This paragraph is just confusing me even further. Of course there's a meaningful conclusion to be found. There isn't ""objective meaning"" here, it's all subjective, so if something has meaning to me, then it is meaningful. I'm not sure what you're getting at. If I roll a die and I hope for any number but 1, then I am both expecting the conclusion to be anything but 1 and that that conclusion, being as likely as it is, can be taken as a conclusion prior to its actual occurrence. I'm not really sure what else I can comment on here.

&gt; What view do you want to have, are you after some optimism? Or what exactly?

"In the end, this might turn out to be a good thing. Past administrations have basically slow walked climate policy by using a ridiculously low calculation of the “social cost of carbon”. The actual social cost of carbon is far higher than the official number used by past administrations. But it is that ridiculously low number that past administrations used to determine how urgently we must adopt renewable energy. Put it this way.: suppose our official understanding of the danger of chain smoking were that you might smell and have the occasional headache. How quickly do you suppose people would cut back on smoking?

Obviously, our first task is to restore the rule of law and meaningful elections and if we fail at that we are staring down into the barrel of collapse

But if we succeed at restoring government we will need to be realistic, setting the real social cost of carbon going forward

"Both parties exploit the division and benefit from the hostility so they take a polarized position and attack the other side no matter what. We saw this during Covid and the election. Our candidates prioritized their political image and weaponized the virus for political gain.

The two party system shifting things back and forth creates a scapegoat and shared responsibility for our issues, but when they play on identity, ego, and fear to pin us further against each other, the blame is always pointed at the other side, leaving no one feeling responsible. We blame our leaders, but only half of them, which they don’t care since they created this division in the first place.  The more damage one side causes the easier it is to get support for the other and when they get power back they can put a few bandaids on the damage and do their own damage and voters will still blame each other’s party.

But we don’t agree. They spend billions on campaigns hiring the best there is in order to keep us from agreeing.

When comparing nuclear power and renewables due to how horrifically expensive, inflexible and slow to build nuclear power is this one of those occasions where we get to pick all three when choosing renewables.

Cost to orbit has always been obscene, mostly packed in the range of $8K-$50K per kg to LEO. If it works, Starship plans to make that under $100 per kg to LEO. Add refueling flights for a Mars mission, and we're still talking maybe $1,000 per kg to Mars. That's 100 tons to Mars for less than it cost for a lot of satellite launches we do all the time. 

Overall it's a question of when. We are going to do it eventually, and someone has to take the first step. Even if it's just a research outpost for the first 50 years, that first step is needed before we go all in.",0

"Tariffs also reduce the price of fossil fuels, increasing demand. At the same time, they inhibit supply chains for emissions reducing projects like transitioning to green energy. Furthermore, they will shift trade from countries with higher environmental standards to lower environmental standards. For example, the rest of the world cutting off US soybean imports means they will import more from Brazil, requiring more destruction of critical rainforest habitat. This will also cause more domestic carbon sink destruction in the US. Further demand for domestic production will destroy habitat, displace species, and cause more domestic emissions. Tariffs on steel and aluminum mean more demand for plastic and, consequently, more fossil fuel exploitation. Trade wars are also a prelude to war, which is a massive cause of emissions. Economic turmoil also means the rollback of regulations so more pollution and emissions will be tolerated. 

There's really no analysis comparing the negative environmental impacts to the positive for this particular set of trade restrictions.",0

"&gt; The treatment and perspective of the Palestinian people by the citizens of Israel is just as bad, if not worse in many ways, than the public opinion of the average German citizen toward Jewish people under the Nazi regime.

This would be extremely difficult to establish, however the way Jews were treated by the Whermacht, SS, SA, and Gestapo was exceptionally horrific and the individuals working for those organizations didn't exist in a vacuum, they were made up of more or less average Germans. You could make the same if not a stronger case for the IDF, since nearly every Israeli citizen is conscripted into it at some point or another

Regardless, ""treating a large group of people badly"" is not unique to the Nazis. I'm aware of the Hilltop Youth, the psychotic genocidal rhetoric of certain fringe Likud politicians now enjoying the mainstream, and the polls conducted on Israeli citizens regarding what they feel should be done on Gaza. It's quite awful, and wicked. However, the escalating tensions between Israel and the Palestinian occupied territories has been a self perpetuating cycle for almost a century. One group becomes more extreme to combat their opposition, then the opposition becomes more extreme to counter. This is also why a sadistic group like Hamas is able to enjoy so much popular support and have a government in Gaza; each side of the conflict escalates the other. 

It's also important to note that the root of the conflict is ultimately a land dispute that has gotten out of hand and become an existential ideological and spiritual one. There isn't an ideological need in Judaism to exterminate Arabs, the genocide is happening outside of the core ideology and political identity of Israel.

In the case of the Nazis, destruction of inferior races, extermination of opposing political ideologies, and removal of the Jews from Europe was the entire basis of their political party. It was who the Nazi's were at their core; destroying the Jews was to the Nazis like ""small government"" or ""trickle down economics"" is to US conservatives. Their genocide of Jews and ""undesirables"" was conducted because they believed these people were poisoning global human society to the point where the end of the human civilization was at risk, not because of generations of fighting over a land dispute",0

* Even how [Humans make up just 0.01% of Earth's life](https://ourworldindata.org/life-on-earth)

From antiquity until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the global population grew very slowly, at about 0.04% per year. After about 1800, the growth rate accelerated to a peak of 2.1% annually 

Human population growth really only took off after the 1500s.  Even then, the population did not reach a billion until 1800s.  Since then it has continued to grow at a rapid rate. (1 billion in 1804, 2B 1927, 3B 1960, 4B 1974, 5B 1987, 6B  1999, 7B  2011, 8B 2022, 9B projected 2035)

"The use of uncertainty as a tool for manipulating the masses was invented by Big Tobacco.  They used it to great effect for a half century, earning them the label:  **Merchants of Doubt**.  Because they realized that if they could cause people to doubt a bad outcome, those people would keep on keeping on:

Cancer is complicated, no one really knows for sure what causes it.  Plenty of people who don't smoke get cancer, some even get lung cancer.  Plus they claimed they had developed safer products: First: Filtered Cigarettes, then Lite cigarettes.

Big Carbon then adopted this playbook:

The Climate is complicated, no one really knows for sure what causes it to warm and cool.  The temperature changed greatly well before humans began burning coal/oil/gas.  Plus we are improving our direct air capture (DAC) and Carbon capture at the stack technology.

As we approach the threshold of certainty, these same people will say: It is too late to change our system, so I guess we (mainly younger people) will need to learn to adapt.

We need to vastly expand the CO2 pipeline network if we are going to have a chance of fixing this. ""Oh but the risk of leaks!"" Yes, this is true, but we've been transporting CO2 via pipeline since the 70s, and there have been limited incidents with essentially no direct fatalities. Try saying that about cars or practically anything else that we engage with daily (walking up/down stairs, eating, etc...). The risk is nonzero but exceedingly low. Ignoring the fact that we learn from these incidents, you have to ask yourself the question, ""Do I want the risk of a temporary CO2 leak from a pipeline or the certainty of climate catastrophe from doing nothing."" 

I strongly support the parallel rollout of zero carbon energy sources, but the reality is that we can't do it fast enough to ignore point source carbon capture, and even if we could, we would still need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. This isn't the only solution, but without it, failure is guaranteed. At least it gives us a chance to return to pre-industrial CO2 levels.",0
"There is a significant religious element to it. I have no issues with Jewish people or Judaism but Daniella Weiss, the self-appointed “godmother of the settlements”, talks at length regarding her religious beliefs and how that is the basis for the ever expanding Israeli settlements.

They believe that Palestine is Judea and that Jewish people should occupy that land and, as Weiss says, “live the Jewish life”; just to note, there isn’t an issue with living “the Jewish life” at least in my opinion but I’m highlighting that it’s used as justification by settlers to illegally occupy Palestine.

There were a lot of issues with how Biden refused to step aside until very late, how Harris was chosen, and her own decisions as a candidate. Also there was a bit of economic bad luck, and the Democratic Party just being the stupid Democratic Party that all contributed. And I'm sure things I didn't list. Racism and misogyny can't be ignored, either.

Regardless of reasons, the election wasn't particularly close. Every state saw more Trump votes than Harris votes as compared to Trump v. Biden. Turnout was a big issue for Democrats; lots of guesses have been made as to why.

The hard spot for Democrats is that they are trying to be everything to everyone. They want Wall Street donors and Silicon Valley donors and unions and Main Street voters and activist organizers and civil rights supporters and celebrity validators, etc. I just don't think that's possible in this political climate. For example, the DNC decided this cycle that it's staying pro-Israel. Fine, it's a strategic decision, I get it. But then they act surprised/angry when pro-Palestine voters go to Jill Stein (and some, inexplicably, went to Trump). They take money from the 1% but seem confused when they start losing unions.

In contrast, Trump is very clear: he's against people who don't want the US to be a Christian nation, he's against undocumented migrants, he's against free trade, he's against federal employees, he's for an authoritarian police state. It's very clear where he stands.

So for the DNC, I think it's less about ""selling"" and more about deciding: who are you for? And more importantly--because you can't be for everyone--who are you against?",1

"&gt;your electricity bill also includes the cost of delivering the electricity to your meter via the transmission and distribution grids, the costs associated with operating and balancing the network, the operational costs of the supplier, various social and environmental levies

Isn't that mostly what the 'standing charge' part of the bill is for?

That's fair enough, but how does that get from 8p to 24.5p?

I think the real reason is because electricity costs are influenced by the costs of generation of all methods - [https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/why-is-cheap-renewable-electricity-so-expensive/](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/why-is-cheap-renewable-electricity-so-expensive/)

"I am well versed in history. But no, I wasn’t there during WW2 or the civil war. I do know that there has rarely been a 100 year span without an armed conflict affecting the Western world right at home. Until recently, I thought we had overcome this cycle of violence and that there would be lasting peace in at least this one small part of the world. But now I am watching every safeguard we had being dismantled, we are heading quickly toward a state where war is possible. In the pre-Trump world, war between Europe, America, China was literally impossible for many reasons. Now these reasons are being slowly removed.

About 10 years ago I decided that politics was rotting my brain, I stopped reading or talking about it and stopped caring. I recently realized that this has been a mistake. Yes I focus on my community (and mine is strong here), but what use is that when it gets destroyed by war or strife. 

The OP’s post was about feeling that something and was about to happen. Unfortunately he is 100% correct to be extremely concerned right now (saying this as someone who devours history books). 

What do you mean what can I do about global warming? This is an issue I’ve been very aware of before the 2000s. Our situation is dire, but we were going to solve it slow and steady just like everything else. Except we haven’t, and now as a society we’re not only denying there is even a problem, the US now wants to accelerate it. Had I known this back then I would have had a different career and I would have fought this directly. The divided world we are in now, where democracy and science is receding in every single continent, was hard to imagine 50 years ago. 

We used to be a species that could achieve anything we set our mind to, like putting a man on the moon!! Now we have huge parts of the population actively fighting to make things worse and to prevent progress. Our collective minds are easy to influence and control, the tools to do so that have been created in the past 10 years are unbelievably effective, and they are controlled by people who do not care in the slightest about anything but their own power.

"We actually have been flooding. Prime example is DC. They have to build a massive break wall and rip out all the cherry trees that were part of the annual cherry blossom festival just to keep the water back in the ocean. Florida as well has begun to lose beach real estate. Japan has seen rising waters, Britain, China, Korea just about every country to have a coast on an ocean has seen this problem. The interesting thing is that the rise in water level is minuscule compared to the reduction in ice volume. This causes a tremendous amount of confusion amongst people who here melting ice caps, often think of the movie Waterworld. But ice display is far more volume than the equal amount of liquid water. This is one of the fascinating things about water itself. So we’re not really left with a problem of Pennsylvania becoming a coastal state. It’s really a slow global death caused by temperature and salinity changes in the oceans.

The real problem is far more nuanced and multi faceted. mostly driven by the changing salinity gradient in the ocean and the release of cold Arctic Waters into a comparatively warm ocean. It is this ocean temperature and salinity that drive a lot of the temperature changes that generate high and low pressure regions. As these regions become more extreme in their pressure and temperature changes this affects atmospheric winds,  which intern  can cause blocking of other high and low pressure regions and acts as a catalyst for larger and more severe storm systems. So while Waterworld is not a reasonable possibility, category two hurricanes becoming category four, tornadoes in places that have never seen tornadoes, droughts, floods, and extreme weather will slowly erode the world as we know it.

The other major thing to consider, which people often overlook, is the concept of thermal mass. This works with cooling substances as well as heating them. But I’m going to use an example of something being heated since it is much more universal. If you ever cook a potato, you will find that you can often pick up the potato with your bare hands, provided that you don’t hold onto it very long. The heat doesn’t come from the surface of the potato, but from the “amount” of the potato that is heated. This idea that mass can hold onto heat, or act as a heat sink is universal in thermal dynamics. 
The same problem applies liquids. As the big ice cubes melt in the ocean local areas of cold water spread out and overtime. The entire temperature of the ocean will lower fractions of a degree. This doesn’t sound like that big of a deal, except like the potato, there is a delay that occurs between this energy absorption and changing in temperature. There’s still some speculation in various journals on exactly how long that lag time is(see the early days of Al Gore) . But you can imagine that what we are currently seeing is from climate change that occurred years ago. What’s scary about this is that even if we could stop all human induced climate change; and assumed that we were lucky going into a period of global cooling on a long-term geologic scale, we will still be seeing more and more severe weather events for years to come.",0

"&gt;Global surface temperatures have risen around 1.3C since the preindustrial (1850-1900) period as a result of human activity.[1](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/exploring-the-drivers-of-modern-global#footnote-1-154099807) However, this aggregate number masks a lot of underlying factors that contribute to global surface temperature changes over time.   
       
&gt;These include CO2, which is the primary driver of long-term warming, as well as non-CO2 greenhouse gases like CH4, N2O, and halocarbons. But it also includes planet-cooling aerosols that have masked a sizable portion of the warming of our greenhouse gas emissions to-date. Rounding out the list are other anthropogenic factors (tropospheric ozone, [albedo changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) due to land use change), and natural forcings (primarily volcanic eruptions and variations in solar output).   
        
&gt;The figure below shows the output of 841 different emission-driven FaIR model runs across the range of constrained parameter values. It simulates both the global surface temperature response to all forcings (in yellow), as well as estimates of each forcing in isolation (calculated by comparing the difference between runs containing all forcings and those excluding one type of forcing).   
        
&gt;[[Figure](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f578183b-1167-410a-9cb9-b3a40ae7185a_2280x1504.png) – **Attributing changes in global surface temperatures from 1850** – Clicking the figure enlarges it.]      
         
&gt;The figure below shows the rate of warming (in degrees C per decade) for each 10-year period between 1905-1914 and 2015-2024. I’ve initially excluded natural forcings from the figure as they result in large changes in decadal trends around major volcanic eruptions.  
         
&gt;[[Figure](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/856c7134-b479-4384-9b20-848378f10da0_2052x1362.png) – **Drivers of Decadal Warming Rates Over Time (1905-2024)**]  
       
&gt;We can draw a few interesting conclusions from this figure:
        
&gt;• The rate of warming increased between the start of the century and 1970, remained relatively flat at just below 0.2C per decade from 1970 to 2005, and has accelerated to ~0.25C per decade over the past decade.  
     
&gt;• The primary driver of this recent acceleration in warming has been declining aerosol emissions. Aerosols have flipped from reducing the rate of decadal warming (as emissions increased) to increasing the rate of warming (as emissions decreased) after 2005.   
     
&gt;• The rate of warming from CO2 has increased over time as emissions have increased, though it has plateaued over the past decade as CO2 emissions have plateaued. However, warming from all greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and others) has been relatively flat since 1970. This is primarily due to the declining contribution of other greenhouse gases to additional warming, likely associated with the phaseout of halocarbons after the Montreal protocol.   
         
&gt;It's important to note that this figure shows the rate of warming rather than total warming (as the prior figures have shown). A slowdown in the rate of warming from a specific forcing (e.g. halocarbons post-Montreal or CH4 in the 1990s-2010s) still means that the total amount of warming forcing is increasing over time, just more slowly.",1

"How about basic biology?

[Soil Formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_formation)

&gt;New soils increase in depth by a combination of weathering and further deposition. The soil production rate due to weathering is approximately 1/10 mm per year.[5] New soils can also deepen from dust deposition. Gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals, starting with pioneer species and proceeding along ecological succession to more complex plant and animal communities.[6] Topsoils deepen with the accumulation of humus originating from dead remains of higher plants and soil microbes.[7] They also deepen through mixing of organic matter with weathered minerals.[8] As soils mature, they develop soil horizons as organic matter accumulates and mineral weathering and leaching take place.

No they dont, cause its not about a single factor but the composition of different scopes of those factors. What factors btw? (I know, but do you?)

Its funny how you, again, ignore all other factors but temperature.

"Everything you've described in your introduction to this thread is correct, OP, and is happening all along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard.

Our window to mitigate these effects has closed and the volatility will only worsen as the BRICS nations continue to emit CO2 as part of their entry into to the group of industrialized nations.

"To /u/NukecelHyperreality, *Your post is under consideration for removal for violating Rule B.*

In our experience, the best conversations genuinely consider the other person’s perspective. Here are some techniques for keeping yourself honest:

- Instead of only looking for flaws in a comment, be sure to engage with the commenters’ strongest arguments — not just their weakest.
- Steelman rather than strawman. When summarizing someone’s points, look for the most reasonable interpretation of their words.
- Avoid moving the goalposts. Reread the claims in your OP or first comments and if you need to change to a new set of claims to continue arguing for your position, you might want to consider acknowledging the change in view with a [delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=changemyview&amp;utm_content=t5_2w2s8) before proceeding.
- Ask questions and really try to understand the other side, rather than trying to prove why they are wrong.

Please also take a moment to review our [Rule B](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_b) guidelines and _really_ ask yourself - am I exhibiting any of these behaviors?

Movies/TV also sometimes push a ton of characters who are all different races/genders/sexualities, this makes the story less relateable/realistic across the board. Often people tend to stick to hanging around mostly people who look/act like them. You never really see friend groups in real life that are that diverse—and if you do, they’re rare.

"Driving in snow is dangerous.  When people move north I tell them to go to a large empty parking lot after it snows.  Drive hard and make the car spin.  You can usually recover the car if you do not panic.  You can definitely crash to ditch instead of colliding with other traffic.  Each car is a little different so I do this often even though I have lost count of fishtailing incidents.  

You want the wheels pointing toward where you want to go whether or not the car is moving “forward”.  Then also adjust slightly for the overcorrection.  Fishtailing is similar to hydroplaning but when the back wheels catch snow piles it torques the car hard in the opposite direction.  The back goes across the ruts and then the wheels hit the other snow pile and whips back the other way.    If you slam the brakes at this moment you can spin 180 or 360 or any other angle.  The snow piles can have a variety of impulses on the wheels while your car is sideways.  

A whiteout in the mountains is an experience.  Driving west you can just stop and wait out the squall.  Or drive really slow.  Driving east the squall line is also moving east.  Moving faster than the storm sort of makes sense.  But then the squall was too intense to see anything.  I knew trucks were behind me and they probably could not see me until it was way to late.  Three cars were somewhere ahead so I *should* have been able to just follow the ruts.  Unfortunately those three drivers had no idea where the road was either.  They had made a bunch of s-curve crisscross patterns on the highway. 

In the midwest or plains you get drifting.  In the extreme cold the snowflakes are smaller and the break into smaller fragments instead of sticking to each other.  This stuff blows sideways even if little or nothing is still coming down.  Sometimes it is a crazy blue color in the sunlight.  Overall the road is *mostly* blown dry or slightly ice coated.  The drifts move sort of like sand dunes.  This can leave piles that are much deeper than the depth of snow in the field.   You suddenly go from driving on mostly concrete to snow over the car’s bumper.  The wind does not often blow perfectly perpendicular to the road so slamming into the drift also deflects your car sideways.  It is at minimum disturbing.  It can also lead to spins or flying into the ditch.  You want to anticipate them and not hit the drift too fast.  Black ice is common in the same places that drifts collect.",0

What happens if on a large scale, artists simply can't keep up once AI improves?

What if we snuff out the careers of people who could truly create something unique and amazing, because it just doesn't make sense before they realize that potential to even try to compete?  

I mean, sure, industries change. The horse caretakers lost a lot when the automobile came out, train industry lost out as highways were created...

But it's just a bit worrying that what we're taking art, a fundamental part of human culture, and threatening it with something that can generally only recycle what came before. Like imagine if the only movies that ever came out in the future were just ""action movie"" with parts and scenes picked out and rearranged over and over. Yes, you could have a lot of high quality movies, but aren't you kneecapped, in some way? Even if you expand ""action movie"" to all movies, would it not still be limited in a way?

Taking an artistic craft and refining it is a satisfying experience, and one I think everyone should try. But what happens when a good chunk of those are just...made almost pointless?

Let's illustrate with an example:  Say you choose to stop flying. Flying is a huge carbon impact, it's arguably the single biggest emitter for any individual who flies even a couple times a year.

Great, so you give up flying. All you've done is making plane tickets a bit cheaper for someone else. Say 1 million other well people like you also give up flying. The airlines notice a drop in demand, they put on a seat sale, and people who otherwise maybe wouldn't have flown now buy the tickets and fly.

Sure, there is some tipping point aggregate amount of reduced demand where the airlines simply have to reduce flights and can't make up the volume on reduced prices, but that takes some kind of organized concerted action of millions of people (effectively a kind of strike).

"To be frank: this is the type of mentality that gotten trump in the White House in the first place.

EDIT: Not just in America, but allover the western world, when you have an entire generation of young disenfranchised men of all colors and creeds, that would end up creating problems, rather it be rising suicide numbers, drug overdoses, or other heinous problems, this African proverb comes to mind in spades - ""A boy will burn the village down to feel its warmth.""

second, and imo that is the big issue, I've never seen that statement sit by itself. the full statement is always ""renewable don't work without nuclear, look at Germany they did that and now burn coal instead"". 

i have NEVER seen nuclear promoted by a political group that wasn't at the same time trying to slow down renewable energy adoption. The whole talking point is always ""we should go nuclear (and keep petrol till then), not invest in renewable"".

*Bootstrap post-collapse technology*

[Winter is coming](http://collapseos.org/why.html) and Collapse OS aims to soften the blow. It is a Forth [(why Forth?)](http://collapseos.org/forth.html) operating system and a collection of tools and documentation with a single purpose: preserve the ability to program microcontrollers through [civilizational collapse](http://collapseos.org/civ.html). It is designed to:

1. Run on minimal and improvised machines.
2. Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).
3. Edit text and binary contents.
4. Compile assembler source for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.
5. Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.
6. Assemble itself and deploy to another machine.

Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible. With a copy of this project, a capable and [creative](http://collapseos.org/why.html#creative) person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools

"I think there's a different gift-giving philosophy out there than the one you're using.  Both are valid, so I'm not saying your approach is wrong, just that there might be a different way you can view this.

The one philosophy is that someone says ""I want &lt;thing&gt;"" and you give them &lt;thing&gt; and that shows love and consideration by giving them what they ask for.

There's another philosophy, and granted it is more on the spectrum of spontaneous gift giving rather than the standard gift based holidays, but there is crossover.

The idea there is that the gift is supposed to represent your love and respect by virtue of the fact that you know what would be meaningful even without knowing what &lt;thing&gt; they would ask for.

It can even be the tiniest trinket that represents your relationship.  Or something that shows, even in a small way, that you saw a way to make their life better that they didn't think to ask for.  Something that says ""I got you this because I wanted you to have it, even if you didn't ask.""

Which is all to end up at the position that if someone doesn't know what they want for Christmas, you don't *have* to get them anything, that's not the same thing as saying you *shouldn't* get them anything.

The distinction there being if you don't know what you want to get them, and they don't know what they want, that's a fine scenario and you don't have to get them a present to fill some sort of gap there.

But on the flip side, if you do want to get them something, and you have an idea for what you want to get them, you absolutely should.  In that case it would be wrong to say that you shouldn't get them anything just because they don't know what they want.",1

"Fully agree with you OP. Bullying idiots works. I’m not sure how people don’t realize it.

Cancel culture used to work. It was effectively cyber bullying people who have abhorrent views or have done abhorrent things. Sure “bullying” has a negative connotation but it worked. People learned not to be openly racist or they would be made a fool in a global public forum.

I’ve been saying that we need to be mean to right wingers. We need to bully them. We need to make fun of them. Call them dumb, stupid, idiotic, make them crawl back to their circle jerks filled with other morons.

Sure, it may not make *all* of them change their views. But some of them, like you, can actually reflect on why they’re being made fun of and change their views.

Where it really benefits though, is it shows other idiots that their type of thinking isn’t socially acceptable. Yes, these people are idiots too. A lot of these idiots voted Trump based on “vibes” alone. All it would take is social pressure to show that voting for Trump is not acceptable. A would be idiot that would vote for Trump can see how much Trump supporters get made fun of and change their mind about voting for him at all.

"I think this is a bad example because appreciating a foreign cuisine is not quite the same as wearing a certain dress of a culture with significant meaning, or adopting aesthetics that originated from oppression and is historically/actively shamed towards the people it’s from.

For example, Capoeira is a Brazilian martial arts with African roots that originated from slavery and was created as a form of resistance disguised as a dance. It would be cultural appropriation to adopt the aesthetics of this martial art without knowing and respecting this history.

"This should help answer your questions. 

https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-much-carbon-dioxide-does-earth-naturally-absorb

Ultimately climate change as we know it takes place naturally over a significantly longer period of time, not just an extra decade or two. The natural carbon cycle absorbs nearly what it emits every year. The issue now is that human activity has continued to destabilize that and caused the natural progression of climate cycles to accelerate significantly. If we were to hypothetically eliminate all of the human emissions overnight, we would certainly likely see restabilization occur (however there would be latency because climate patterns have inertia).

As far as CO2 concentration goes: ""A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years [through human activities]."" - https://www.che-project.eu/news/how-do-human-co2-emissions-compare-natural-co2-emissions

Tldr: Our ability to reduce emissions and lower the atmospheric CO2 concentration will extend the planet's climate cycle duration significantly.",1

"I don't like how the article is phrased at multiple points and could lead people to misunderstand what is really going on. I guess that is the price of simplifying something, so I can't blame the author to harshly. I just think a few key points should have been hit at least.

Firstly, IMO it's important to make the distinction that it is not the first thorium reactor, experimental thorium reactors have existed for decades. The TMSR-FL1 is notable and sick because it uses molten salt (LiF and BeF2) which circumvents the high pressure containment needs of using water as a coolant/heat transfer fluid.

The article also doesnt explicitly explain the fact that U-233 is the primary fissile fuel used to produce the energy in a thorium reactor. 

Some information makes sense not to mention, like the actually stating the decay chain and timings between. However, I think there is a better medium you can hit describing it to maximize the amount of correct information given while balancing it with simplicity? This is my attempt, but I definitely sacrifice some brevity with this:

In the reactor, you use a small amount of fissile material, in this instance it's a HALEU (High-Assay, Low Enrichment Uranium) in a UF4 compound, to kick-start the transmutation of stable Th-232 into unstable Th-233. The Th-233 starts it's decay chain, until in a few days you start getting Pa-233 (it's got like a month long half-life). As you get Pa-233, you want to remove it from the main reaction chamber so it can naturally decay into U-233 (if you kept it in, a substantial portion would transmute into Pa-234 instead of decaying into U-233, which goes on a different decay chain and leads to inefficiency and problems). You want to take the Pa-233 out, and then when it becomes U-233 you put it back in. The U-233 will continue giving off neutrons when it fissions, transmuting the Th-232 to Th-233. Remove fission products. Boom your breeding and have an efficient cycle. Keep adding more Th-232 as it runs out, keep removing the Pa-233 as it accumulates, keep adding back in the U-233, remove the fission products, and bobs your uncle!",0
